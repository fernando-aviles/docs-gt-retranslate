## Choose your path

### Web editor approach

<Info>
**Perfect for**: Content creators, marketers, technical writers, and anyone who wants to start quickly without setup.
</Info>

The web editor provides a complete documentation authoring experience directly in your browser:

- **Zero setup**: Start writing immediately without installing anything
- **Live preview**: See changes instantly as you type
- **Git integration**: Automatically syncs with your GitHub repository
- **Collaborative editing**: Multiple team members can edit simultaneously
- **Built-in publishing**: Deploy changes with a single click

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign up and connect your repository">
  Create a Mintlify account and connect your GitHub repository at [mintlify.com/start](https://mintlify.com/start).
</Step>

<Step title="Start editing">
  Use our web editor to create and modify documentation pages with live preview.
  
  <Tip>
  The web editor includes syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and real-time collaboration features.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Publish your changes">
  Click **Publish** to deploy your documentation instantly to the web.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Local development approach

<Info>
**Perfect for**: Developers who prefer working locally, teams with complex workflows, or projects requiring custom scripts and automation.
</Info>

Local development gives you full control over your documentation workflow:

- **Your preferred editor**: Use VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or any editor you love
- **Git workflow**: Standard branching, pull requests, and version control
- **Advanced features**: Custom scripts, automated testing, and CI/CD integration
- **Offline editing**: Work without an internet connection
- **Performance**: Faster for large documentation sites

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Node.js">
  Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 16 or later) on your machine.
  
  <Check>
  Verify installation by running `node --version` in your terminal.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">
  Continue to our [CLI installation guide](/installation) for detailed setup instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">
  Clone your documentation repository locally and start the development server.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Comparison: Web editor vs. local development

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Feature comparison">
| Feature | Web editor | Local development |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Setup time** | Instant | ~5 minutes |
| **Internet required** | Yes | No (after setup) |
| **Collaboration** | Real-time | Git-based |
| **Editor features** | Built-in | Your choice |
| **Advanced workflows** | Limited | Full control |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent |
| **Learning curve** | Minimal | Moderate |
</Tab>

<Tab title="Use cases">
**Choose web editor if you:**
- Want to start immediately without setup
- Primarily write content rather than code
- Work in small teams with simple workflows
- Prefer browser-based tools
- Need real-time collaboration

**Choose local development if you:**
- Are comfortable with command-line tools
- Have existing git-based workflows
- Need custom build processes or scripts
- Work with large documentation sites
- Prefer your own code editor
- Want to work offline
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Hybrid approach

<Note>
You're not locked into one approach! Many teams use both methods:

- **Content creators** use the web editor for writing and editing
- **Developers** use local development for structure, configuration, and complex changes
- **Everyone** benefits from automatic git synchronization between approaches
</Note>

Both methods work with the same underlying MDX files and `docs.json` configuration, so you can switch between them seamlessly.
