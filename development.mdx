</Info>

## Installation and Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">
    Choose any of the following package managers to install Mintlify globally on your machine:

    <CodeGroup>

      ```bash npm
      npm i -g mintlify
      ```

      ```bash yarn
      yarn global add mintlify
      ```

      ```bash pnpm
      pnpm add -g mintlify
      ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the development server">
    Navigate to your docs folder (where `mint.json` is located) and run:

    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```

    The preview will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Don't want to install Mintlify globally? You can run it directly:
      <CodeGroup>
        ```bash npm
        npx mintlify dev
        ```

        ```bash yarn
        yarn dlx mintlify dev # Requires yarn >2
        ```

        ```bash pnpm
        pnpm dlx mintlify dev
        ```
      </CodeGroup>
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Configuration Options

### Change Preview Port

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. You can use a different port by adding the `--port` flag:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the specified port is in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port:
```bash
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

### Check for Broken Links

Keep your documentation reliable by checking for broken links:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Updating Mintlify

Each CLI release corresponds to a specific version of Mintlify. To ensure you have the latest features and fixes, update regularly:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Editor Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend:

1. Install the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting
2. Install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting
