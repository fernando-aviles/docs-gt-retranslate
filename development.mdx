<Note>
  Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js version 19 or higher installed on your computer. You can check your Node.js version by running `node --version` in your terminal.
</Note>

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing the CLI Tool

First, you'll need to install the Mintlify command-line interface (CLI). Choose one of these commands based on your package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mintlify
```
</CodeGroup>

### Running the Development Server

Once installed, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Your Docs">
    Open your terminal and go to your documentation directory (where your `docs.json` file is located).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the Preview">
    Run this command to start your local development server:
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Your Docs">
    Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Don't want to install the CLI globally? You can use these run commands instead:

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Tip>

## Common Tasks

### Using a Different Port

Need to run on a different port? Use the `--port` flag:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

<Info>
  If the port you specify is already in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port.
</Info>

### Checking for Broken Links

Keep your documentation reliable by checking for broken links:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

### Updating Your CLI Version

To ensure you're using the latest features, regularly update your CLI:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm up --global mintlify
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

### Code Formatting
For the best writing experience, we recommend:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="MDX Extension" icon="brackets-curly">
    Install the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for proper syntax highlighting
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prettier" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to automatically format your documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Development server won't start" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Try these steps in order:
    1. Check your Node.js version (`node --version`)
    2. Delete the `~/.mintlify` folder
    3. Reinstall the CLI: `npm remove -g mintlify && npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title='Error: "sharp" module not loading' icon="wrench">
    This usually means you need to update Node.js:
    1. Remove Mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Update to Node.js v19 or higher
    3. Reinstall: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Changes not showing up" icon="rotate">
    Try these solutions:
    1. Clear your browser cache
    2. Restart the development server
    3. Check for syntax errors in your MDX files
