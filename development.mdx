<Info>

**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.

</Info>

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Alternatively, if you don't want to install Mintlify globally, you can use a run script:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Yarn's `dlx` run script requires Yarn version >2. See [here](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx) for more information.
</Warning>

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will automatically use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The Mintlify CLI can help validate reference links in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

After a successful deployment, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

For optimal code formatting and syntax recognition, we recommend using extensions in your IDE. For VSCode users, we suggest:
- [MDX VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This error may occur due to an outdated version of Node.js. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of Mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js v19 or higher
    3. Reinstall Mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
