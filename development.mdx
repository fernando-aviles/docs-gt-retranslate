## Quick Setup

Set up local development in two simple steps to preview your documentation changes.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 19 or higher
</Info>

### Step 1 - Install Mintlify

First, install the Mintlify CLI which lets you preview your docs locally:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mintlify
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2 - Start Development Server

Go to the docs directory where your `mint.json` is located and run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The CLI will start a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to your documentation will automatically reload in real-time.

<Tip>
  Don't want to install Mintlify globally? You can run it directly using npx:
  `npx mintlify dev`
</Tip>

## Configuration

### Custom Port

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. Use the `--port` flag to use a different port:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the specified port is already in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port.

### Versions

Each CLI release is tied to a specific version of Mintlify. If you notice differences between your local preview and the deployed site, you may need to update:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm up --global mintlify
```
</CodeGroup>

## Development Tools

### Link Validation

Keep your documentation reliable by checking for broken links. Run this command in your docs directory:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

### IDE Setup (Recommended)

For the best development experience, we recommend:

1. Install the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for proper syntax highlighting
2. Install [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for automatic formatting

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='"sharp" Module Error on Mac'>
    If you see an error about the "sharp" module on macOS, try these steps:
    1. Remove mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Update Node.js to v19 or higher
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title='Unknown Error When Running Dev'>
    If you encounter an unexpected error:
    1. Delete the `~/.mintlify` folder from your home directory
    2. Run `mintlify dev` again
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment Success

When your changes are successfully deployed, you'll see a confirmation screen like this:
