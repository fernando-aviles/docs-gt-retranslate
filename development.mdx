## Prerequisites

<Info>
Please make sure you have **Node.js version 19 or higher** installed before proceeding with the setup.
</Info>

## Installation

### Installing Mintlify CLI

You can install Mintlify globally on your system using your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

### Alternative Installation

If you prefer not to install Mintlify globally, you can use it directly through package manager execution commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
If you're using Yarn's "dlx" command, note that it requires Yarn version >2. Learn more about dlx [here](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx).
</Warning>

## Running Locally

### Starting the Development Server

1. Navigate to your docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located)
2. Run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Your documentation preview will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Port Configuration

#### Default Port

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. You can customize this using the `--port` flag:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

#### Port Conflicts

If your specified port is already in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port:

```bash
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Maintenance

### Version Management

The CLI version needs to match Mintlify's platform version. If you notice discrepancies between local and production previews, update your CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Link Validation

Check for broken references in your documentation using:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Development Tools

### Code Editor Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend:

1. [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting
2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting

### Deployment Verification

After a successful deployment, you should see a confirmation screen:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png"
    alt="Deployment success screen showing all checks passed"
  />
</Frame>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Module Loading Error (Sharp)'>
    If you encounter the error: "Could not load the sharp module using the darwin-arm64 runtime", follow these steps:

    1. Remove existing Mintlify installation: 
    ```bash
    npm remove -g mintlify
    ```
    2. Upgrade Node.js to v19 or higher
    3. Reinstall Mintlify: 
    ```bash
    npm install -g mintlify
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unknown Errors">
    For unexpected errors:

    1. Navigate to your device's root directory
