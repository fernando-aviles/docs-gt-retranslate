## Setting Up Local Development

Get your documentation running locally in three simple steps:

### Step 1: Install the Mintlify CLI

The Mintlify CLI (Command Line Interface) helps you run and test your documentation locally. Install it using one of these commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Don't want to install globally? You can run it directly:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev # Requires yarn >2
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Go to Your Docs Folder

Navigate to the folder containing your docs (where your `mint.json` file is located).

### Step 3: Start the Development Server

Run this command to start your local docs:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Once started, you can view your documentation at `http://localhost:3000`. The preview updates automatically when you save changes to your files.

## Common Tasks

### Using a Different Port

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. To use a different port, add the `--port` flag:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the port you specify is already in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port.

### Checking for Broken Links

Keep your documentation reliable by checking for broken links:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

This command scans your docs and reports any broken internal links.

### Updating Mintlify

If your local preview looks different from your deployed site, you might need to update Mintlify. Use one of these commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Editor Setup

To make editing documentation easier, we recommend installing:

1. [MDX VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) - Adds syntax highlighting for MDX files
2. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Helps format your code consistently
