## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. Installed Node.js version 19 or higher
2. Access to a command line terminal
3. Your documentation files on your local machine

<Tip>
  Not sure if you have Node.js installed? Open your terminal and run `node --version`. If you see a version number â‰¥ 19, you're good to go. If not, [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/).
</Tip>

## Setting Up Local Development

### Step 1: Install Mintlify CLI

Choose one of these commands to install the Mintlify CLI (Command Line Interface) tool:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Don't want to install globally? You can run Mintlify directly:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If using Yarn, make sure you have version 2 or higher for the `dlx` command. [Learn more](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx)
</Note>

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to your documentation folder (where `mint.json` is located)
3. Run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Your documentation will now be available at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to your documentation files will automatically appear on this local preview.

## Customizing Your Setup

### Using a Different Port

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. To use a different port:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If your chosen port is already in use, Mintlify will automatically try the next available port:
```text
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

### Updating Mintlify

Keep your Mintlify CLI up to date to ensure you have the latest features. Update using the same tool you used to install:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Development Tools

### Check for Broken Links

Find and fix broken links in your documentation with this command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

### Code Editor Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend:

1. Install the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for proper syntax highlighting
2. Use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for consistent formatting
