<Info>
**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

## Installation

**Step 1**: Install the Mintlify CLI:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

If you prefer not to install the CLI globally, you can use one of these run scripts instead:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Yarn's "dlx" run script requires Yarn version 2 or higher. For more information, see the [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx).
</Warning>

Once started, a local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will automatically select the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Version Management

Each CLI release corresponds to a specific version of Mintlify. If your local preview doesn't match the production version, update the CLI using one of these commands:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Link Validation

The CLI includes a tool to help validate reference links in your documentation. To check for broken links, use:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

After a successful deployment, you should see a confirmation screen similar to this:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

For the best development experience, we recommend using IDE extensions that support MDX. For Visual Studio Code users, we suggest:

- [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>
    This error typically occurs with outdated Node.js versions. To resolve:

    1. Remove the current Mintlify installation: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node.js v19 or higher
    3. Reinstall Mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
