<Info>

**Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.

</Info>

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `mint.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

If you prefer not to install Mintlify globally, you can use one of these available run scripts:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx mintlify dev
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx mintlify dev
  ```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The Yarn "dlx" run script requires Yarn version >2. See the [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/dlx) for more information.
</Warning>

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port by using the `--port` flag. For example, to run Mintlify on port 3333, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If the specified port is already in use, Mintlify will automatically use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't match the production version, update the CLI using one of these commands:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify@latest
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn global upgrade mintlify
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm up --global mintlify
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI includes a tool to help validate reference links in your documentation. To identify broken links, use this command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

A successful deployment will show this confirmation screen:

    className="rounded-md"
    src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We recommend using IDE extensions to properly handle and format MDX files. For VSCode users, we suggest:

- The [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting

## Troubleshooting
