description: Mintlify is a platform that helps you build and deploy beautiful, LLM and SEO-friendly documentation.

Mintlify is a framework that helps you build and deploy documentation. You create MDX files with our custom components to build your docs.

Under the hood, Mintlify powers your search, analytics, and more. This allows you to focus on building your product and leave the documentation to us.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Mintlify can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast documentation.

## Editing experience

Mintlify uses a git-based workflow to track changes and deploy your docs. This is a convenient workflow for most developers because they can use their existing tools to edit their docs. However, if you're not familiar with git, we also have a web-based editor that you can use to edit your docs.
