## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/api-reference/update/trigger).

## Assistant API key

The Assistant API allows you to embed the AI assistant experience grounded in your docs and continually kept up to date into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

<Note>
  The Assistant API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

## PDF Reference Documents

The AI Assistant API supports uploading PDF reference documents to enhance the assistant's knowledge base. This feature allows you to provide additional context and information that the AI can reference when answering questions.

### Upload PDF Documents

Use the PDF upload endpoints to add reference materials to your AI Assistant's knowledge base:

- **Upload**: Add new PDF documents to the knowledge base
- **List**: Retrieve all uploaded PDF documents
- **Update**: Modify metadata or replace existing documents
- **Delete**: Remove documents from the knowledge base

### Managing PDF References

The API provides comprehensive management capabilities for your PDF reference documents:

- **Query**: Search through uploaded documents based on content or metadata
- **Categorize**: Organize documents by type, topic, or priority
- **Version Control**: Track different versions of the same document
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions for document access

### Best Practices

When uploading PDF documents through the API:

- Ensure PDFs contain searchable text for optimal indexing
- Use descriptive filenames and metadata for better organization
- Keep documents up-to-date by replacing outdated versions
- Organize documents into logical categories for efficient retrieval

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI assistant. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
