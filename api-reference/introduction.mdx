## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/api-reference/update/trigger).

## Assistant API key

The Assistant API allows you to embed the AI assistant experience grounded in your docs and continually kept up to date into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

<Note>
  The Assistant API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI assistant. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [assistant.mintlify.com](https://assistant.mintlify.com).
