# Frequently Asked Questions

Find answers to the most common questions about our API. If you can't find what you're looking for, feel free to [contact our support team](mailto:support@example.com).

## Getting Started

<details>
<summary>How do I get started with the API?</summary>

To get started with our API:

1. Sign up for an account at [our developer portal](https://developer.example.com)
2. Create an API key in your dashboard
3. Review our [Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quickstart)
4. Make your first API call using our [interactive examples](/api-reference/examples)

For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started documentation](/getting-started).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you offer a sandbox or testing environment?</summary>

Yes, we provide a sandbox environment for testing your integrations. The sandbox uses the same API endpoints but with test data and doesn't affect your production environment.

- Sandbox Base URL: `https://sandbox-api.example.com`
- Production Base URL: `https://api.example.com`

Learn more about our [testing environments](/getting-started/environments).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What programming languages do you support?</summary>

Our API is RESTful and can be used with any programming language that supports HTTP requests. We provide official SDKs for:

- JavaScript/Node.js
- Python
- PHP
- Ruby
- Go
- Java

Community SDKs are also available for other languages. Check our [SDKs page](/sdks) for the complete list.

</details>

## Authentication

<details>
<summary>How do I authenticate my API requests?</summary>

We use API key authentication. Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

You can generate and manage your API keys in the [developer dashboard](https://developer.example.com/dashboard).

For detailed authentication information, see our [Authentication Guide](/api-reference/authentication).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I keep my API key secure?</summary>

To keep your API key secure:

- Never expose your API key in client-side code
- Store API keys as environment variables
- Use different keys for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Regularly rotate your API keys
- Monitor your API key usage in the dashboard

See our [Security Best Practices](/security/best-practices) for more information.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use multiple API keys for the same account?</summary>

Yes, you can create multiple API keys for different purposes or environments. Each key can have different permissions and rate limits configured.

To manage your API keys, visit your [developer dashboard](https://developer.example.com/dashboard/api-keys).

</details>

## Rate Limits

<details>
<summary>What are the rate limits for the API?</summary>

Our rate limits vary by plan:

- **Free Plan**: 1,000 requests per hour
- **Pro Plan**: 10,000 requests per hour
- **Enterprise Plan**: Custom limits available

Rate limits are enforced per API key. When you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

For current rate limit information, see our [Rate Limits documentation](/api-reference/rate-limits).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I check my current rate limit usage?</summary>

Rate limit information is included in every API response header:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your rate limit ceiling for that given request
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests left for the time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: UTC date/time when the rate limit resets

You can also monitor usage in your [developer dashboard](https://developer.example.com/dashboard/usage).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when I hit the rate limit?</summary>

When you exceed your rate limit, the API will return:

- HTTP Status Code: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Error message explaining the rate limit exceeded
- `Retry-After` header indicating when you can make requests again

Implement exponential backoff in your application to handle rate limit responses gracefully.

</details>

## Error Handling

<details>
<summary>What HTTP status codes does the API return?</summary>

Our API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- **200**: Success
- **201**: Created
- **400**: Bad Request
- **401**: Unauthorized
- **403**: Forbidden
- **404**: Not Found
- **429**: Too Many Requests
- **500**: Internal Server Error

Each error response includes a detailed error message and error code. See our [Error Handling Guide](/api-reference/errors) for complete details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How should I handle API errors in my application?</summary>

Best practices for error handling:

1. Always check the HTTP status code
2. Parse the error response for detailed information
3. Implement retry logic for temporary errors (5xx codes)
4. Log errors for debugging purposes
5. Provide meaningful error messages to your users

Example error response structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "The 'email' parameter is required",
    "details": "Please provide a valid email address"
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there any known issues or limitations?</summary>

Current known limitations:

- Maximum request payload size: 10MB
- Maximum response size: 50MB
- Request timeout: 30 seconds
- Some endpoints have additional specific limitations

Check our [Status Page](https://status.example.com) for current system status and any ongoing issues.

</details>

## Data and Responses

<details>
<summary>What data formats does the API support?</summary>

Our API supports:

- **Request format**: JSON (Content-Type: application/json)
- **Response format**: JSON
- **Date format**: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- **Character encoding**: UTF-8

All requests and responses use JSON format unless otherwise specified.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I handle pagination in API responses?</summary>

Large result sets are paginated using cursor-based pagination:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "has_more": true,
    "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIzfQ=="
  }
}
```

Use the `next_cursor` value in your next request to get the next page of results.

See our [Pagination Guide](/api-reference/pagination) for detailed examples.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I filter or sort API responses?</summary>

Yes, many endpoints support filtering and sorting through query parameters:

- **Filtering**: `?filter[status]=active&filter[type]=premium`
- **Sorting**: `?sort=created_at&order=desc`
- **Field selection**: `?fields=id,name,email`

Available filters and sort options vary by endpoint. Check the specific endpoint documentation for supported parameters.

</details>

## Best Practices

<details>
<summary>What are the recommended best practices for using the API?</summary>

Key best practices:

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for API requests
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling and retry logic
3. **Cache responses**: Cache API responses when appropriate to reduce requests
4. **Use webhooks**: Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates
5. **Validate data**: Always validate data before sending requests
6. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of your API usage and performance

For comprehensive guidelines, see our [Best Practices Guide](/best-practices).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I optimize API performance?</summary>

Performance optimization tips:

- Use field selection to request only needed data
- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed data
- Use batch endpoints when available
- Compress request payloads when sending large amounts of data
- Keep connections alive when making multiple requests
- Monitor response times and optimize accordingly

</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I use webhooks or polling?</summary>

**Use webhooks when**:
- You need real-time updates
- You want to reduce API calls
- You're building event-driven applications

**Use polling when**:
- Webhooks aren't available for your use case
- You need to maintain control over request timing
- Your infrastructure doesn't support receiving webhooks

Learn more about [Webhooks](/webhooks) and when to use them.
