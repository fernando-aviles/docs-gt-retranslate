## Webhook Support

This endpoint supports webhook notifications for status updates. When a status is retrieved or modified, relevant webhook events will be triggered to notify subscribed endpoints.

### Webhook Events

- `status.retrieved` - Triggered when a status is successfully fetched
- `status.updated` - Triggered when a status is modified (if applicable)

### Webhook Configuration

To receive webhook notifications for status updates:

1. Configure your webhook endpoint in the project settings
2. Subscribe to the relevant status events
3. Ensure your endpoint can handle the webhook payload format

For more information on webhook configuration and payload formats, see the [Webhooks Documentation](/webhooks).
