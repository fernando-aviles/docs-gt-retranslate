## Webhook Support

This endpoint supports webhook notifications for project updates. When a project is successfully updated, a webhook event will be triggered to notify subscribed endpoints.

### Webhook Event

- **Event Type**: `project.updated`
- **Payload**: Contains the updated project data and metadata about the update
- **Delivery**: Webhooks are delivered asynchronously after the update operation completes

To configure webhook endpoints for this trigger, refer to the webhook configuration section in your project settings.
