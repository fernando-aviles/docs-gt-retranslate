Mintlify supports localization through its versioning system, allowing you to create documentation in multiple languages.

## Setting Up Localization

Add localization support by configuring the `versions` field in your `mint.json` file with locale specifications.

```json
"versions": [
  {
    "name": "English",
    "locale": "en"
  },
  {
    "name": "Español",
    "locale": "es"
  }
]
```

The first localization in the array serves as the default language.

## Supported Languages

Mintlify currently supports the following languages:

- English (`en`)
- Chinese (`cn`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- French (`fr`)
- Japanese (`jp`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- German (`de`)

<Note>
  The locale codes must match exactly as shown above to enable automatic
  translation of UI elements.
</Note>

## Organization

There are several ways to organize your localized content:

### Option 1: Folder Structure

Create separate folders for each language:

```
content/
├── en/
│   ├── quickstart.mdx
│   └── api-reference.mdx
├── es/
│   ├── quickstart.mdx
│   └── api-reference.mdx
└── fr/
    ├── quickstart.mdx
    └── api-reference.mdx
```

### Option 2: Version Property

Specify the locale in your navigation groups or individual pages:

```json
"navigation": [
  {
    "group": "Getting Started",
    "version": "en",
    "pages": ["quickstart", "installation"]
  },
  {
    "group": "Comenzar",
    "version": "es",
    "pages": ["es/quickstart", "es/installation"]
  }
]
```

Or in the page metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Quickstart"
version: "es"
---
```

## What Gets Translated

Localization in Mintlify works in two parts:

1. **UI Elements** - Fixed content like "Was this page helpful?" and navigation elements are automatically translated based on the selected locale.

2. **Documentation Content** - You are responsible for translating your actual documentation content, including:
   - Page content
   - Navigation labels
   - Page titles and descriptions
   - Component content

<Warning>
  Mintlify does not automatically translate your documentation content. You must
  provide translations for all content you want to be available in different
  languages.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consistent Structure">
    Maintain the same structure across all languages. Each translated version should mirror the organization of your primary language.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Default Language">
    Always specify a default language by putting it first in the versions array, or by explicitly setting `default: true`:

    ```json
    "versions": [
      {
        "name": "English",
        "locale": "en",
        "default": true
      }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Control">
    Consider using branches or folders in your repository to manage different language versions effectively.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Shared Content

Content without a specified version or locale appears in all language versions. This is useful for:

- Images and other assets
- Code examples
- API references
- Universal components
