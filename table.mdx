## Creating a Table

Tables follow standard [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables). Create them using pipes (`|`) to separate columns and three or more hyphens (`---`) for headers.

Example:
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |
