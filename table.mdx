## Creating a Table

<Tip>
The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).
</Tip>

Create tables using three or more hyphens (`---`) for column headers and pipes (`|`) to separate columns. Add pipes on either end of each row for compatibility.
