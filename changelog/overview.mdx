    </Frame> 
    Keep your docs private by adding password protection. You can use JWT, OAuth, or a simple password that everyone shares. This helps you create private internal documentation or keep your content away from competitors.

  ## Code Line Highlighting

  Want to draw attention to specific lines of code? You can now highlight them by adding numbers in curly braces after the language name.

  ```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```

  ````md

  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  function sayHello() {
    console.log(greeting);
  }
  sayHello();
  ```
  ````
