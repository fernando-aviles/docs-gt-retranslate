Display code snippets with advanced features like syntax highlighting, line highlighting, and custom labels.

## Basic Usage

Add code by wrapping it in three backticks (```). This is known as a fenced code block.

```
console.log("Hello World");
```

```md Example
\```
console.log("Hello World");
\```
```

## Adding Language Syntax

Make your code blocks prettier by adding syntax highlighting. Just add the language name after the first three backticks.

```javascript
// User data example
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false
};
```

```md Example
\```javascript
// User data example
const user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: false
};
\```
```

<Tip>
  We support many programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, Ruby, and more through [Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages). Check the full list at [Test Drive Prism](https://prismjs.com/test.html#language=markup).

## Adding Labels

Add a label to your code block by putting text after the language name. This helps identify what the code example is showing.

```python Configuration Example
# Set up database connection
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_USER = "admin"
DB_PASS = "secretpassword"
```

```md Example
\```python Configuration Example
# Set up database connection
DB_HOST = "localhost"
DB_USER = "admin"
DB_PASS = "secretpassword"
\```
```

## Highlighting Important Lines

Draw attention to specific lines by adding line numbers in curly braces after the label. You can highlight:
- Single lines: `{1}`
- Multiple lines: `{1,3}`
- Line ranges: `{1-3}`

```javascript Line Highlighting {1,3-4}
const API_KEY = "abc123"; // This line is highlighted
function getData() {
  // These lines are highlighted
  fetch(`/api/data?key=${API_KEY}`)
    .then(response => response.json());
}
```

```md Example
\```javascript Line Highlighting {1,3-4}
const API_KEY = "abc123";
function getData() {
  // These lines are highlighted
  fetch(`/api/data?key=${API_KEY}`)
    .then(response => response.json());
}
\```
```

## Multiple Code Examples

## Common Use Cases

Here are some typical ways to use code blocks:

### API Examples
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'
  }
});
```

### Configuration Files
```yaml
version: 1.0
settings:
  theme: dark
  notifications: true
```

### Command Line Instructions
```bash
npm install mintlify
mintlify dev
```
