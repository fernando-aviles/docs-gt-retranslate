Mintlify supports OAuth 2.0 authentication using the PKCE flow, allowing you to integrate with your existing OAuth server for user authentication.

## Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up your User Info endpoint">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    - Accepts an OAuth access token
    - Returns user information in the [UserInfo](./sending-data) format
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure OAuth settings">
    Navigate to your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/mintlify/mintlify/settings/deployment/user-authentication) and configure:
    - Authorization URL
    - Client ID
    - Required scopes
    - Token URL
    - Info API URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the redirect URL">
    Copy the Redirect URL from your Mintlify dashboard and add it to your OAuth server's allowed redirect URLs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Configuration

Here's a simple example for docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`:

```json
{
  "authorizationUrl": "https://auth.foo.com/authorization",
  "clientId": "ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH",
  "scopes": ["docs-user-info"],
  "tokenUrl": "https://auth.foo.com/exchange",
  "infoApiUrl": "https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info"
}
```

The user info endpoint (`api.foo.com/docs/user-info`) requires an access token with the `docs-user-info` scope and returns user data according to Mintlify's specifications.
