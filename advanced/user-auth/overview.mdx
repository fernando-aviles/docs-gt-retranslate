User Auth enables you to authenticate users and personalize their documentation experience. Here are the key features:

1. **Customize MDX content** with user information (name, plan, title)
2. **Prefill API keys** in the API Playground
3. **Control page visibility** based on user groups

## Limitations

User Auth is not suitable for:
- **Private docs content** - Pages remain accessible via direct URL
- **User database storage** - Mintlify doesn't store user data

<Note>For private docs solutions, [contact our team](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).</Note>

## Implementation

### MDX Content Customization
Access user information with the `userContext` variable:

```jsx
Hello, {userContext.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

<Note>
  Always use optional chaining (e.g., `userContext.org?.plan`) as `userContext` is `{}` for logged-out users.
</Note>

### API Key Prefilling
API Playground inputs are automatically prefilled when matching field names are returned in user info.

### Page Visibility Control
Control page access using the `groups` field in page metadata:

```md
---
title: 'Page Title'
groups: ['admin']
---
```

Page visibility is determined by matching user groups with page metadata groups. Pages without `groups` are visible to all users.
