User Auth lets you identify and authenticate users to create personalized documentation experiences.

## Key Features

1. **Custom Content** - Display user-specific information like names and plan details
2. **API Integration** - Auto-fill API keys in the API Playground
3. **Access Control** - Show/hide pages based on user groups

## What User Auth Is Not

1. **Not for Private Docs** - Pages remain accessible via direct URLs
2. **Not a User Database** - Mintlify doesn't store user data

<Note>Need private docs? [Contact our team](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) for solutions.</Note>

## Using User Auth

### Personalizing Content

Access user information through the `userContext` variable:

```jsx
Hello, {userContext.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

<Note>
  Always use optional chaining (e.g., `userContext.org?.plan`) since `userContext` is empty (`{}`) for logged-out users.
</Note>

### API Key Integration

API Playground inputs are automatically prefilled when matching field names are provided in the user info.

### Page Visibility Control

Control page visibility using the `groups` field in page metadata:

```md
---
title: 'Example Page'
groups: ['admin']
---
```

Page visibility rules:
- No `groups` in metadata: Visible to all
- Empty `groups` array: Hidden from all
- Specific groups: Only visible to users in those groups
