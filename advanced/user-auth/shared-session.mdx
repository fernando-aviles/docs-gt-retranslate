title: 'Shared Session Auth'
description: 'Seamlessly share user sessions between your dashboard and your docs'
---

Share your existing user authentication between your dashboard and documentation for a seamless experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    - Uses your existing session authentication
    - Returns user data in the [UserInfo](./sending-data) format
    - Includes proper CORS headers if your API and docs domains differ:
      ```
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: your-docs-domain.com
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
      ```
      
    <Warning>
      Only enable these CORS settings on your user info endpoint, not across all API routes.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Mintlify Settings">
    Add your API URL and Login URL in your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/mintlify/mintlify/settings/deployment/user-authentication).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Setup

Your setup will depend on where your dashboard and docs are hosted:

- **Same domain** (e.g., `foo.com/dashboard` and `foo.com/docs`): 
  No special CORS configuration needed

- **Different subdomains** (e.g., `dash.foo.com` and `docs.foo.com`): 
  Configure CORS headers for the docs domain on your user info endpoint</fileContent>
