<Check>
  Custom JS is available as an add-on to the [pro plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing).

Custom JS allows you to add executable code that runs on every page of your documentation, similar to adding a global `<script>` tag.

## Implementation

Place any `.js` file in your content directory to include it globally. Example `ga.js` for Google Analytics:

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```
