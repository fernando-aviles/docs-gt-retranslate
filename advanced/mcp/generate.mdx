<Tip>
  This page is dedicated to setting up your own MCP Server. If you are looking
  for information on using the Mintlify MCP Server, please refer to the
  [Installing and using the Mintlify MCP Server](/advanced/mcp/quickstart) page.
</Tip>

## Get Started

Run `npm i mcp` to install the MCP CLI.

In the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/mcp), navigate to the `MCP Server` section. On this page, toggle the view to see your unique installation command. This command will install your MCP Server using the MCP CLI.

<Note>
  Make sure to toggle OpenAPI access to allow the MCP Server to access **all**
  endpoints in your OpenAPI specification.
</Note>

## Start the MCP Server Locally

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Server through the CLI">
    Run the following command to install the server:
    ```bash
    npx mcp add [your subdomain]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Authentication Token (if applicable)">
    If your API requires an authentication token, instruct your end-customer to provide it when prompted with this response:
    ```
    > What is the Authorization (basic token)?
    ```
    If authentication is not required, you can skip this step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start your MCP Server">
    You can now run:
    ```bash
    npm --prefix ~/.mcp/[your subdomain] start
    ```
  </Step>
