import { VercelJsonGenerator } from "/snippets/vercel-json-generator.mdx";

<Steps>
  <Step title="Move your docs files">
    Edit your file structure so that all your files are within a folder which is your custom subpath. So if you want to host your docs at `/docs` you would do the following:

    ```
    /docs
      introduction.mdx
      navigation.mdx
    docs.json
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your vercel.json">
    In your main website add the following rewrites to your `vercel.json`.

    <VercelJsonGenerator />
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  For more information, you can also refer to Vercel's offical guide on
  rewrites: [Project Configuration:
  Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites)
