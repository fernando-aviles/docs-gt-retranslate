description: "Host documentation at a subpath using Vercel"
---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Move your docs files">
    Edit your file structure so that all your files are within a folder which is your custom subpath. So if you want to host your docs at [my-cool-custom-domain.com/docs](http://my-cool-custom-domain.com/docs) you would do the following:

    ```
    /docs
      introduction.mdx
      navigation.mdx
    docs.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your vercel.json">
    In your main website add the following rewrites to your `vercel.json`. Make sure to replace `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your subdomain.

    ```json
    {
      "rewrites": [
        {
          "source": "/api/request",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/api/request"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory/llms.txt",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/llms.txt"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory/llms-full.txt",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/llms-full.txt"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory/sitemap.xml",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/sitemap.xml"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory/robots.txt",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/robots.txt"
        },
        {
          "source": "/custom/subdirectory/:path*",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/custom/subdirectory/:path*"
        },
        {
          "source": "/mintlify-assets/:path+",
          "destination": "https://[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app/mintlify-assets/:path+"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
