## Trigger Updates

You can use our REST API to automatically start updates whenever you need them.
The main purpose is to let you control when updates happen. We're working on adding more
features to the API over time. Have suggestions? Share them with us in
[our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!

## Authentication

To use the API, you'll need an API key. You can create one through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/integrations). This key works for your whole organization and can be used across all your deployments.

## Discovery API

The Discovery API helps you add AI-powered chat to your documentation. This chat feature understands your docs and stays current with any changes you make.
When the AI responds, it includes references to show users exactly where the information came from.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to begin:
1. First, create a Discovery API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/chat/widget):

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Create a Discovery API key"
    src="/images/generate-discovery-api-key.png"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  There are two types of keys:
  - The Discovery API token is public and can be used in your website's code
  - The API key is private and should be kept secure on your server
</Note>

Once you have your API key, you can see how to use it by checking out our [example code](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example). Want to see it in action? Visit [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com) to try a live demo.
