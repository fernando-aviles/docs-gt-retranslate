## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

<Info>
  While the primary use case will be to trigger updates, we will be adding more functionality to the API over time. Let us know what else you would like to see in
  [our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with the entire organization and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API Key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger).

## Chat API Key

The Chat API allows you to embed an AI chat experience into any application of your choosing. This chat experience is grounded in your documentation and continuously kept up to date.

Responses include citations, allowing you to point your users to the specific documentation pages they need for help.

<Note>
  The Chat API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code, whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI chat. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
