## Trigger Updates

Use our REST API to programmatically trigger documentation updates. Additional API functionality will be added based on user feedback. Share your suggestions in [our community](https://mintlify.com/community).

## Discovery API

The Discovery API enables AI-powered chat experiences within your documentation. Key features:
- Embedded chat interface for any application
- Responses include citations to source documentation
- Automatically stays synchronized with your content

### Setup

1. Generate a Discovery API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/chat/widget):

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Create a Discovery API key"
    src="/images/generate-discovery-api-key.png"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  The Discovery API token is public and safe for frontend code. Keep the API key secure on your server side.
</Note>

2. See our [example implementation](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) or view the [live demo](https://chat.mintlify.com).
