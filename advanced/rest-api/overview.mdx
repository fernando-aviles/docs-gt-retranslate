## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger updates when desired.

<Info>
  While the primary use case is triggering updates, we will be adding more functionality to the API over time. Let us know what else you would like to see in
  [our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with your entire organization and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API Key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API endpoints. Its primary use is triggering updates via the [Update endpoint](/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger).

## Chat API Key

The Chat API allows you to embed an AI chat experience, grounded in your documentation and continuously kept up to date, into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations, enabling you to direct your users to the specific documentation sections they need.

<Note>
  The Chat API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code, whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example repository](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) to learn how to use
the API for AI chat. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
