## Introduction
The Mintlify REST API enables you to programmatically interact with your documentation, trigger updates, and embed AI-powered chat experiences. This guide covers the key features and authentication requirements.

## Triggering Updates

You can leverage the [Update API](/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger) to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

An update will automatically take the newest version of your documentation on your chosen deployment branch, build it, and deploy it.

## Embedded AI Chat

The Chat API allows you to embed an AI chat experience with full knowledge of your docs into your own webpages.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

Successful examples of embedding the chat experience include:

- [Mintlify's own chat demo](https://chat.mintlify.com)
- The [Lovable help center](https://lovable.dev/support)

Check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use the API for AI chat.

## Authentication

You can generate API keys through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). API keys are associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.
