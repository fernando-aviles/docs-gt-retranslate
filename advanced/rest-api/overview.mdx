## Trigger Updates

Use our REST API to trigger updates programmatically. More API functionality is in development - share feature requests in [our community](https://mintlify.com/community).

## Authentication

Generate your API key in [the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/integrations). One API key works for all deployments in your org.

## Discovery API

The Discovery API lets you embed AI chat into any app. The chat is powered by your docs and provides cited responses to help users find information.

## Getting Started

1. Generate a Discovery API key in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/chat/widget):

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Create a Discovery API key"
    src="/images/generate-discovery-api-key.png"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Discovery API tokens are public and safe for frontend code. API keys are for server-side use only and should remain private.
</Note>

See our [example implementation](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) or check out the live demo at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
