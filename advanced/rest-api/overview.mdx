## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

<Info>
  While the primary use case will be to trigger updates, we will be adding more functionality 
  to the API over time. Let us know what else you want to see in 
  [our community](https://mintlify.com/community)!

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through 
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is 
associated with the entire organization and can be used across multiple deployments.

## Admin API Key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API endpoints. It is primarily used to trigger 
updates via the [Update endpoint](/advanced/rest-api/update/trigger).

## Chat API Key

The Chat API allows you to embed an AI chat experience into any application of your choosing. 
This chat is grounded in your documentation and is continually kept up to date.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

<Note>
  The Chat API token is a public token that can be referenced in your 
  frontend code, whereas the Admin API key is a server-side token that should be kept 
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example repository](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use 
the API for AI chat. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).
