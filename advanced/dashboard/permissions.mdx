description: 'Allow more members of your team to update your docs'
---

The team member who created your initial documentation will have update access to your docs, as long as they push to your documentation repository with the same GitHub account used during Mintlify signup.

If another editor attempts to update the docs while on the free plan, you will see a warning in your GitHub commit check.

In the details of the GitHub check warning, you'll find a link to upgrade your plan. You can upgrade your plan on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors to update your documentation. Once you upgrade, trigger a manual update or push another change to deploy your updates.
