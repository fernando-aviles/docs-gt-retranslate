title: 'Editor Permissions'
description: 'Allow more members of your team to update your docs'

<Note>
Currently, we only support GitHub as a way to manage editor permissions. We are working on implementing role-based access control (RBAC) in the dashbaord to allow users to set an admin who has special permissions such as inviting users.
</Note>


## Who is an editor and what permissions do they have?
An editor means the user has access to the web editor, can trigger updates on Github and generate preview deployments (if your plan includes this feature).

## How do I add an editor?
You can add a new editor or a user by going to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) and clicking on `Invite Members` in the sidebar..
<Warning>
The `Hobby` plan only allows 1 editor. If another editor attempts to update the docs while on this plan, you will see a warning in your git commit check.

In the details of the git check warning, you'll find the link to upgrade your plan. You can also upgrade your plan on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors to update your docs. Once you upgrade your plan, trigger a manual update or push another change to deploy your updates.
