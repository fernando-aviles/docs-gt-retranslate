title: 'Editor Permissions'
description: 'Allow more members of your team to update your docs'
---

The team member who created your initial documentation will have update access to your docs, provided they push to your documentation repository using the same GitHub account that was used during Mintlify signup.

If another editor attempts to update the docs while on the free plan, a warning will appear in your git commit check.

You can find the upgrade link in the details of the git check warning. Alternatively, you can upgrade your plan directly through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors for your documentation. After upgrading, either trigger a manual update or push a new change to deploy your updates.
