## PDF Upload Feature

<Info>
  **New Feature**: The PDF Upload feature allows you to enhance your AI Assistant with custom reference materials, making it more knowledgeable about your specific documentation and processes.
</Info>

### Overview

The PDF Upload feature enables you to upload reference documents that your AI Assistant can use to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This is particularly useful for:

- Internal documentation and procedures
- Technical specifications and standards
- Style guides and writing standards
- Product documentation and user manuals

### How to Upload PDFs

1. **Access Upload Interface**
   - Navigate to **Settings** → **AI Assistant** → **Knowledge Base**
   - Click the **Upload PDF** button

2. **Select Your Files**
   ```bash
   Supported formats: PDF
   Maximum file size: 50MB per file
   Maximum total storage: 500MB
   ```

3. **Configure Upload Settings**
   - **Document Title**: Provide a descriptive name
   - **Category**: Organize by type (e.g., "Style Guide", "API Docs")
   - **Priority Level**: Set importance for reference weighting
   - **Access Level**: Define who can reference this document

<Warning>
  Ensure your PDFs contain searchable text. Scanned documents without OCR may not be properly indexed.
</Warning>

### Processing and Indexing

Once uploaded, your PDFs undergo automatic processing:

1. **Text Extraction**: Content is extracted and cleaned
2. **Semantic Indexing**: Documents are analyzed for key concepts
3. **Cross-Referencing**: Links between documents are established
4. **Quality Validation**: Content quality is assessed

## Best Practices for PDF References

### Document Preparation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Optimize Content Structure">
    Ensure your PDFs have clear headings, consistent formatting, and logical organization
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Metadata">
    Add relevant titles, authors, and descriptions to improve searchability
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Updates">
    Keep documents current by uploading new versions when information changes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality Control">
    Review documents for accuracy and completeness before uploading
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Naming Conventions

Use consistent naming patterns for better organization:

```
[Category]_[Topic]_[Version]_[Date].pdf

Examples:
- StyleGuide_Writing_v2.1_2024.pdf
- API_Authentication_v1.0_Jan2024.pdf
- Procedures_Deployment_v3.2_2024.pdf
```

### Content Guidelines

<Tip>
  **Pro Tip**: Documents with clear structure, bullet points, and examples work best with the AI Assistant's processing algorithms.
</Tip>

- **Use clear headings** (H1, H2, H3) for better content parsing
- **Include examples** and code snippets where applicable
- **Add cross-references** to related documents
- **Maintain consistent terminology** across all documents

### Categorization Strategy

Organize your documents into logical categories:

| Category | Description | Example Documents |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Style Guides | Writing and formatting standards | Brand guidelines, tone of voice |
| Technical Specs | API docs, system requirements | Architecture diagrams, API references |
| Procedures | Step-by-step processes | Deployment guides, troubleshooting |
| Templates | Reusable document formats | Report templates, meeting notes |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Upload Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload Failed - File Too Large">
    **Solution**: Reduce file size by:
    - Compressing images within the PDF
    - Removing unnecessary pages
    - Splitting large documents into smaller sections
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Text Not Searchable">
    **Cause**: PDF contains scanned images without text layer
    
    **Solution**: 
    - Use OCR software to add text layer
    - Re-create document from original source
    - Convert to text-based PDF format
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Processing Stuck">
    **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    1. Check file format compatibility
    2. Verify document isn't password protected
