Mintlify provides three dashboard access levels: Editor, Admin, and Owner.

The following describes actions that are limited to the Admin and Owner roles:

|                         | Editor | Admin | Owner |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :---: | :---: |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |  ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |  ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite admin users      |   ❌   |  ❌   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |  ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |  ✅   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |  ✅   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |  ✅   |  ✅   |

Other actions on the dashboard are available to all roles.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.
