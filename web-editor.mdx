description: 'Edit your docs directly from the dashboard with live previews.'

The Web Editor is the preferred way to edit docs directly without having to open your IDE or run `mintlify dev`.

The editor includes key features that integrate directly into your existing Git workflow,
like creating branches, pull requests, commits, and diffs for your current changes.

It also includes a fully editable experience for changing and adding content directly,
even with custom components.

If you understand Git workflows and our integrations already, you can skip to [here](#editing-content).

## Git and Update Workflows

### Git Basics

While Web Editor means you don't need to go to GitHub or your command line to make
changes, it's still helpful to know the basics of Git.

Git terminology:

- **Repository**: The folder in which your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub).

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

- **Branch**: A separate line of development. It's a working copy of the code that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version.

- **Pull Request:** A request to merge changes from a working branch into the main branch. This is used for reviewing content before making changes live.

### Making Updates

To make updates to your docs, we include buttons specifically to 
integrate with your Git workflow.

<Note>
  If you haven't done so already, please install the Mintlify GitHub app to your GitHub account.
  You can find [documentation here](#1-deploying-your-docs-repository), or you can install
  the app in the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app)
  page of the dashboard.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating New Branches">
    To make changes to your docs, you might want to change from the main branch
    to avoid publishing directly to your main docs site.

    To do this, open the Branches modal on the top left of the editor.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    From here, you can either switch to a different Git branch than `main`, or you can
    create a new branch by clicking the **"New Branch"** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    After you create a new branch, you'll automatically be switched, and all changes
    you make will be made to this new branch until you change branches again or reload the page.

    By default, when you load the page again, you'll default to the main branch.

    <Tip>
      As a best practice, you should always create a new branch to make changes so you can submit a Pull Request for review by other teammates. You also may not have permissions to make changes to the main branch, in which case we'll try to open a Pull Request for you.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a Commit">
    To make a commit, you have two options, both of which appear on the top
    right of the editor:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Main Branch">
        If you're on the main branch of your docs repository, you can push a commit
        directly to the repo by clicking the **"Publish"** button. You'll see your changes
        reflect in your Git branch the next time you run `git pull`.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Different Branch">
        If you're not on the main branch, you can push a commit to your branch by clicking
        on the **"Save Changes"** button. If you're ready to publish a Pull Request to put your branch
        up for review, you can click the **"Publish Pull Request"** button.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This will create the Pull Request for you on GitHub using the branch you selected onto
    your main branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a Pull Request">
    When you submit your Pull Request for review, you can edit the title and description
    of the PR, but a default Mintlify title will be provided for you if you leave it
    empty.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/pr-modal-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/pr-modal-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Content

### Slash Commands

The easiest way to add content in the editor is by using **"Slash Commands"**, which are
commands you have access to after typing `/` in the **"Visual Editor"** mode:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

As you type, you'll see more options appear:

<Frame caption="Command filtering">
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

#### Content Blocks

Here are the types of content blocks available to add in the **"Visual Editor"**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Markdown Blocks">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card icon="paragraph" href="/text#text-formatting" horizontal>Paragraph</Card>
      <Card icon="heading" href="/text#titles" horizontal>Headings</Card>
      <Card icon="list-ul" href="/list-table#unordered-list" horizontal>Bullet List</Card>
      <Card icon="list-ol" href="/list-table#ordered-list" horizontal>Numbered List</Card>
      <Card icon="table" href="/list-table#tables" horizontal>Table</Card>
      <Card icon="image" href="/image-embeds" horizontal>Image</Card>
      <Card icon="block-quote" href="/text#blockquotes" horizontal>Blockquote</Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Mintlify Components">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card icon="circle-exclamation" href="/content/components/callouts" horizontal>Callouts</Card>
      <Card icon="square-caret-down" href="/content/components/accordions" horizontal>Accordions</Card>
      <Card icon="table-rows" href="/content/components/accordion-groups" horizontal>Accordion Group</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangle" href="/content/components/cards" horizontal>Cards</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangles-mixed" href="/content/components/card-groups" horizontal>Card Group</Card>
      <Card icon="code" href="/content/components/code" horizontal>Code Block</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangle-code" href="/content/components/code-groups" horizontal>Code Group</Card>
      <Card icon="window-restore" href="/content/components/tabs" horizontal>Tabs</Card>
      <Card icon="arrow-progress" href="/content/components/steps" horizontal>Steps</Card>
      <Card icon="frame" href="/content/components/frames" horizontal>Frames</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangle-history" href="/content/components/update" horizontal>Update</Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding Images

To add images to your page, type `/image` and either click on the **"Image"**
option or press <kbd>â†“</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the **"Image"** option.

This will open the image modal where you have the option to either upload a new
image or use an existing image from the repository.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/images-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/images-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

You can upload an image through the modal:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

You can also preview an existing image before adding it.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Editing Images

To edit images, hover over the image to see the **"Delete"**
and **"Edit"** buttons on the top right of the image.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Clicking the **"Edit"** button lets you edit the attributes of the image.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

If you want to update the source of an image to a new image that you haven't yet
uploaded, you must first delete the existing image, then add a new one
using the [instructions above](#adding-images).

## Editor Modes

To offer the most flexibility, the editor has three modes:

<Frame caption="View mode toggle">
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Visual Editor

The **"Visual Editor"** is the typical WYSIWYG mode you'd see in something like Notion.
It offers a view into your docs in a fully editable way that reflects what the final
page would look like on your main docs site.

### Source Editor

The **"Source Editor"** offers a way to edit your MDX files in code, the same way
you'd do in your IDE. This offers less flexibility since our components aren't available
for auto-complete, but it does have two unique advantages:

1. It allows you to edit props of components (see our [limitations below](#current-limitations))
which is currently not available in **"Visual Editor"** mode.

2. It allows you to correct syntax errors which might have appeared in your repository that
might not be compatible with **"Visual Editor"** mode until fixed.

### Diff View

The **"Diff View"** lets you view the changes made to a specific document before
committing it to your repository.

This helps you see changes you've made along with formatting changes made by
the editor.

## Current Limitations

We do have a few current limitations in the editor that we're working to resolve:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WYSIWYG Navigation Tree">
    You currently cannot live-update your navigation based on added/edited files. You
    still have to manually edit renamed, added, and deleted files in your `mint.json`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Snippet Previews">
    We currently don't show any previews for custom snippets. This is on our roadmap to support
    as fully editable components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI Previews">
    We currently don't show any previews for OpenAPI specs. This is on our roadmap to support
    as a read-only preview.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
