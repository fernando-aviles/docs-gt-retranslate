Web Editor is the preferred way to edit docs directly without having to open your IDE or run `mintlify dev`.

The editor includes features that integrate directly with your existing Git workflow, including:
- Creating branches
- Creating pull requests
- Making commits 
- Viewing diffs of your current changes

It also provides a fully editable experience for changing and adding content directly, even with custom components.

If you understand Git workflows and our integrations already, you can skip to [here](#editing-content).

## Git and Update Workflows

### Git Basics

While Web Editor means you don't need to go to GitHub or your command line to make changes, it's still helpful to know the basics of Git.

Git terminology:

- **Repository**: The folder where your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub).

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

- **Branch**: A separate line of development. It's a working copy of the code that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version.

- **Pull Request:** A request to merge changes from a working branch into the main branch. This is used for reviewing content before making changes live.

### Making Updates

We provide several buttons to help integrate with your Git workflow.

<Note>
  If you haven't done so already, please install the Mintlify GitHub app to your GitHub account.
  You can find [documentation here](#1-deploying-your-docs-repository), or you can install
  the app in the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app)
  of the dashboard.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating new branches">
    When making changes to your docs, you may want to work on a branch separate from main
    to avoid publishing directly to your main docs site.

    To do this, open the branches modal on the top left of the editor.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    From here, you can either:
    - Switch to an existing branch other than `main`
    - Create a new branch by clicking the **"New Branch"** button

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    After creating a new branch, you'll automatically be switched to it. All changes
    you make will be on this new branch until you:
    - Switch to a different branch
    - Reload the page

    By default, when you reload the page, you'll return to the main branch.

    <Tip>
      Best practice: Always create a new branch for changes so you can submit a pull request for team review. You may not have permissions to make changes to the main branch directly, in which case we'll help you open a pull request.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a commit">
    To make a commit, you have two options available in the top right of the editor:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Main branch">
        On the main branch, you can push commits directly to the repository by clicking
        the **"Publish"** button. Your changes will be reflected in your Git branch after
        your next `git pull`.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Different branch">
        On other branches, you can:
        - Push commits using the **"Save Changes"** button
        - Create a pull request for review using the **"Publish Pull Request"** button

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Using the pull request option will create a GitHub pull request from your current branch to the main branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creating a pull request">
    When creating a pull request for review, you can customize:
    - The title
    - The description 

    If left empty, we'll provide a default Mintlify title.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/pr-modal-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/pr-modal-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Content

### Slash Commands

The easiest way to add content is using **"Slash commands"**. These commands become
available after typing `/` in the **"Visual Editor"** mode:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

As you type, available options will filter:

<Frame caption="Command filtering">
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

#### Content Blocks

Here are the content blocks available in the **"Visual Editor"**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Markdown Blocks">
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card icon="paragraph" href="/text#text-formatting" horizontal>Paragraph</Card>
      <Card icon="heading" href="/text#titles" horizontal>Headings</Card>
      <Card icon="list-ul" href="/list-table#unordered-list" horizontal>Bullet List</Card>
      <Card icon="list-ol" href="/list-table#ordered-list" horizontal>Numbered List</Card>
      <Card icon="table" href="/list-table#tables" horizontal>Table</Card>
      <Card icon="image" href="/image-embeds" horizontal>Image</Card>
      <Card icon="block-quote" href="/text#blockquotes" horizontal>Blockquote</Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>

      <Card icon="code" href="/content/components/code" horizontal>Code Block</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangle-code" href="/content/components/code-groups" horizontal>Code Group</Card>
      <Card icon="window-restore" href="/content/components/tabs" horizontal>Tabs</Card>
      <Card icon="arrow-progress" href="/content/components/steps" horizontal>Steps</Card>
      <Card icon="frame" href="/content/components/frames" horizontal>Frames</Card>
      <Card icon="rectangle-history" href="/content/components/update" horizontal>Update</Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding Images

To add images, you can:
1. Type `/image` 
2. Either:
   - Click the **"Image"** option
   - Press <kbd>â†“</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on the **"Image"** option

This opens the image modal where you can:
- Upload a new image 
- Use an existing image from the repository

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/images-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/images-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Upload an image through the modal:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Or preview an existing image before adding it:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Editing Images

To edit images:
1. Hover over the image
2. Look for the **"Delete"** and **"Edit"** buttons on the top right

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

The **"Edit"** button allows you to modify the image attributes:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

To update an image with a new one that isn't yet uploaded:
1. Delete the existing image
2. Add the new image following the [instructions above](#adding-images)

## Editor Modes

We offer three editing modes for maximum flexibility:

<Frame caption="View mode toggle">
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Visual Editor

The **"Visual Editor"** provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface
similar to Notion. It shows your docs exactly as they'll appear on your main site,
while remaining fully editable.

### Source Editor

The **"Source Editor"** lets you edit your MDX files directly in code, similar to
an IDE. While it offers less component auto-completion, it provides two key advantages:

1. Full component prop editing capability (see our [limitations below](#current-limitations)),
   which isn't yet available in **"Visual Editor"** mode

2. The ability to fix syntax errors that might prevent **"Visual Editor"** mode
   from working properly

### Diff View

The **"Diff View"** shows changes made to a document before committing to your
repository. This helps you review:
- Your content changes
- Any formatting changes made by the editor

## Current Limitations

Our editor has a few current limitations we're working to resolve:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WYSIWYG Navigation Tree">
    You cannot yet live-update navigation based on file changes. Manual edits
    to `mint.json` are still required for renamed, added, or deleted files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Snippet Previews">
    Custom snippet previews are not yet available. We plan to add support for
    fully editable components.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI Previews">
    OpenAPI spec previews are not yet available. We plan to add read-only
    preview support.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
