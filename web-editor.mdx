  Mintlify Web Editor is currently in beta. Contact us at [support@mintlify.com](mailto:support@mintlify.com) with feedback.
</Warning>

Web Editor lets you edit docs directly without opening your IDE or running `mintlify dev`. It includes git workflow integration for branches, pull requests, and commits, plus a fully editable experience with custom components.

## Git Workflow Integration

### Making Updates

<Note>
  Install the Mintlify GitHub app to your GitHub account via the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    Use the branches modal on the top left to create or switch branches. Creating a new branch is recommended for changes requiring review.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make changes">
    Edit your content using either Visual Editor or Source Editor mode. Changes are tracked automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit and publish">
    - On main branch: Click **"Publish"** to push changes directly
    - On other branches: Click **"Save Changes"** to commit, or **"Publish Pull Request"** for review
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor Features
