Web Editor allows you to edit docs directly without using an IDE or running `mintlify dev`. It includes git workflow features and a fully editable experience with custom components.

## Git Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**: Click the branches modal on the top left to create or switch branches.
2. **Make Changes**: Edit your content using the editor.
3. **Commit Changes**: 
   - On main branch: Click "Publish"
   - On other branches: Click "Save Changes" or "Publish Pull Request"

<Note>
  Install the Mintlify GitHub app from the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) before making changes.
</Note>

## Editing Content

### Using Slash Commands

Type `/` in Visual Editor mode to access commands for adding:
- Standard blocks (paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, images, blockquotes)
- Mintlify components (callouts, accordions, cards, code blocks, tabs, steps, frames)

### Managing Images

- Add images: Type `/image` to upload or select existing images
- Edit images: Hover over an image to see edit and delete options

## Editor Modes

1. **Visual Editor**: WYSIWYG editing with live preview
2. **Source Editor**: Direct MDX code editing
3. **Diff View**: Review changes before committing

## Current Limitations

- Navigation tree cannot be live-updated
- No preview for custom snippets or OpenAPI specs
- Some keyboard navigation issues
