The Web Editor is the preferred way to edit docs directly without having to open your IDE or run `mintlify dev`.

The editor includes several key features that integrate directly into your existing Git workflow:
- Creating branches
- Making pull requests 
- Creating commits
- Viewing diffs for your current changes

It also provides a fully editable experience for changing and adding content directly, including custom components.

If you already understand Git workflows and our integrations, you can skip to [here](#editing-content).

## Git and Update Workflows

### Git Basics

While the Web Editor means you don't need to use GitHub or your command line to make changes, it's still helpful to understand the basics of Git:

Git terminology:

- **Repository**: The folder where your code lives. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (like GitHub).

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository.

- **Branch**: A separate line of development. It's a working copy of the code that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version.

- **Pull Request:** A request to merge changes from a working branch into the main branch. This is used for reviewing content before making changes live.

### Making Updates

To make updates to your docs, we provide several buttons that integrate with your Git workflow.

<Note>
  If you haven't already installed the Mintlify GitHub App to your GitHub account,
  please do so. You can find [documentation here](#1-deploying-your-docs-repository), or you can install
  the app in the [GitHub App page](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app)
  of the dashboard.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creating New Branches">
    When making changes to your docs, you might want to work on a branch other than main
    to avoid publishing directly to your main docs site.

    To do this, open the branches modal on the top left of the editor.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/branches-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    From here, you can either switch to a different Git branch or create a new branch by clicking the **"New Branch"** button.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
      <img src="/images/editor/new-branch-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>

    After creating a new branch, you'll automatically switch to it. All changes you make will be on this new branch until you change branches again or reload the page.

    By default, when you reload the page, you'll return to the main branch.

    <Tip>
      As a best practice, always create a new branch when making changes so you can submit a pull request for review by other teammates. You may not have permissions to make changes to the main branch directly, in which case we'll help you open a pull request.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a Commit">
    There are two ways to make a commit, both accessible from buttons on the top right of the editor:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Main Branch">
        If you're on the main branch of your docs repository, you can push a commit
        directly by clicking the **"Publish"** button. Your changes will appear in your Git branch the next time you run `git pull`.

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/publish-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Different Branch">
        If you're not on the main branch, you can:
        - Push a commit to your branch by clicking the **"Save Changes"** button
        - Create a pull request for review by clicking the **"Publish Pull Request"** button

        <Frame>
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
          <img src="/images/editor/pull-request-button-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
        </Frame>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    This will create the pull request on GitHub from your selected branch to the main branch.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Making a Pull Request">
    When creating a pull request, you can customize the title and description.
    If you leave these fields empty, we'll provide a default Mintlify title.

      <img src="/images/editor/pr-modal-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Content

### Slash Commands

The easiest way to add content is using **"Slash Commands"**. These commands are available after typing `/` in the **"Visual Editor"** mode:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

As you type, the list of available commands will filter:

<Frame caption="Command Filtering">
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/slash-commands-text-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

#### Content Blocks

Here are the types of content blocks available in the **"Visual Editor"**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Markdown Blocks">

    </CardGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Adding Images

To add images to your page:
1. Type `/image`
2. Either click the **"Image"** option or press <kbd>â†“</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

This opens the image modal where you can:
- Upload a new image
- Use an existing image from the repository

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/images-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/images-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Upload an image through the modal:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/upload-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Preview an existing image before adding it:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-preview-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Editing Images

To edit images:
1. Hover over the image
2. Look for the **"Delete"** and **"Edit"** buttons on the top right

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/edit-image-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Click the **"Edit"** button to modify the image attributes.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/image-form-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

To update an image with a new one that hasn't been uploaded yet:
1. Delete the existing image
2. Add a new one using the [instructions above](#adding-images)

## Editor Modes

The editor offers three modes for maximum flexibility:

<Frame caption="View Mode Toggle">
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Visual Editor

The **"Visual Editor"** provides a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) interface similar to Notion.
It shows you exactly how your content will appear on your main docs site while allowing full editing capabilities.

### Source Editor

The **"Source Editor"** lets you edit your MDX files directly in code, similar to working in an IDE. While it offers less component auto-completion than the Visual Editor, it provides two key advantages:

1. You can edit component props (see our [limitations below](#current-limitations))
which isn't yet available in the **"Visual Editor"** mode.

2. You can fix syntax errors that might prevent content from displaying correctly in the **"Visual Editor"** mode.

### Diff View

The **"Diff View"** shows changes made to a document before committing to your repository. This helps you:
- Review your content changes
- See formatting adjustments made by the editor

## Current Limitations

The editor currently has these limitations we're working to resolve:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WYSIWYG Navigation Tree">
    You cannot live-update your navigation based on file changes. You must manually edit the `mint.json` file when renaming, adding, or deleting files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Snippet Previews">
    We don't currently show previews for custom snippets. Adding support for fully editable components is on our roadmap.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="OpenAPI Previews">
    We don't currently show previews for OpenAPI specifications. Adding read-only preview support is on our roadmap.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
