    Pre-built elements like warning boxes, code examples, and tabs that make your docs more interactive and organized.

## Quick Tips for Success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple" icon="baby">
    Begin with basic content and add more complex features as you get comfortable. You don't need to use every feature right away!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Preview Your Changes" icon="eye">
    Always test your changes locally using `mintlify dev` before publishing. This helps catch any issues early.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Components Wisely" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Components like Notes, Cards, and Tabs can make your docs more engaging - but use them where they add value, not just for decoration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Your Audience in Mind" icon="users">
    Write for your readers' technical level. If you're unsure, it's better to explain too much than too little.

## Common Beginner Questions

<Accordion title="What's the difference between preview and production?" defaultOpen>
  - **Preview** (localhost:3000): Where you see changes while working locally
  - **Production** (your-site.mintlify.app): Your live documentation that users can access
  - Changes need to be committed and deployed to appear in production
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I organize my documentation?">
  Start with these basic sections:
  1. Getting Started/Quick Start
  2. Core Concepts
  3. Main Features
  4. API Reference (if applicable)
  5. Troubleshooting/FAQs

  You can always reorganize later as your documentation grows!
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I make a mistake?">
  Don't worry! You can:
  - Use version control (Git) to track and undo changes
  - Preview changes locally before publishing
  - Edit published content anytime through the dashboard
  - Contact support if you need help fixing something
