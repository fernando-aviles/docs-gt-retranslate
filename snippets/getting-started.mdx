## Quick Setup Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your docs repository">
    Start by creating a new repository using our [starter template](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). This gives you a pre-configured setup with example pages.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mintlify/starter.git my-docs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your content">
    Replace the content in the starter template with your own documentation:

    1. Update `mint.json` with your site name and navigation
    2. Replace the MDX files in the starter with your own content
    3. Add your logo and favicon to the `/public` folder

    <Tip>
      Keep the example pages around until you're comfortable with how everything works. They're great reference material!
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview locally">
    Install our CLI to preview your docs as you work:

    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    mintlify dev
    ```

    Your docs will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy">
    Once you're ready, push your changes to GitHub and connect your repository in our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). We'll automatically build and deploy your docs.
  </Step>
