# Developer Guide

This guide explains key concepts you'll encounter while using Mintlify. You can import this guide into any page where technical concepts need explanation.

## Key Concepts

### What is MDX?

MDX is like Markdown with superpowers. If you're familiar with writing in Markdown (using `#` for headings, `*` for bullet points), MDX lets you do all that plus:

- Use React components right in your documentation
- Import and reuse content across pages
- Add interactive elements like tabs and accordions

```md Example MDX
# My Page Title

This is regular markdown text.

<Tip>
  This is a Mintlify component inside markdown!
</Tip>
```

### Components

Components are pre-built elements you can use to make your docs more interactive and visually appealing. Think of them like building blocks - you just need to add them to your page and customize the content.

<CodeGroup>
```md Component Example
<Card title="Getting Started">
  Start building your docs site with Mintlify.
</Card>
```

```md Result
<Card title="Getting Started">
  Start building your docs site with Mintlify.
</Card>
```
</CodeGroup>

### File Structure

Your documentation is organized into:

- **Pages**: Individual `.mdx` files that contain your content
- **Navigation**: Defined in `mint.json` to organize your pages into a sidebar
- **Snippets**: Reusable content pieces stored in the `snippets/` folder

```
your-docs/
├── mint.json      # Main configuration file
├── introduction.mdx
├── quickstart.mdx
└── snippets/      # Folder for reusable content
    └── example.mdx
```

### Configuration Basics

The `mint.json` file is your control center. Here's a minimal example:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Project",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg"
  },
  "navigation": [
    {
      "group": "Getting Started",
      "pages": ["introduction", "quickstart"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Terms

<ResponseField name="Metadata" type="Content at the top of MDX files">
  The information between `---` at the start of each page that defines properties like title and description.

```yaml
---
title: "My Page"
description: "A great page about my product"
---
```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Components" type="Pre-built UI elements">
  Ready-to-use elements like `<Card>`, `<Tip>`, or `<CodeGroup>` that add functionality to your docs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Snippets" type="Reusable content blocks">
  Content you can import and reuse across multiple pages, stored in the `snippets/` folder.
</ResponseField>
