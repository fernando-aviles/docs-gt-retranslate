API pages can be complex, and several common issues may arise. Here's a list of problems we frequently see and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    When all OpenAPI pages are blank, this typically means either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mintlify dev` locally will reveal most of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document's validity:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the same validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, the issue likely lies elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you will encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) 
    by selecting Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3:

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/convert-oas-3.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This issue usually stems from a mismatched `openapi` field in the page metadata. Ensure
    the HTTP method and path exactly match those in your OpenAPI document.

    Here's an example of a common mismatch:

```md get-user.mdx
---
openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
---
```

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  "/users/{id}":
    get: ...
```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, while the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is referencing the wrong OpenAPI file. When specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, verify the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata should look like this:

```md api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
---
openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
---
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    For sites with a custom domain, this may be caused by your reverse proxy configuration. By
    default, the API Playground makes `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path on your docs site. 
    If your reverse proxy only allows `GET` requests, these API Playground requests will fail. 
    To resolve this, configure your reverse proxy to allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

    If you cannot configure your reverse proxy to accept `POST` requests, you can set Mintlify 
    to send requests directly to your backend using the `api.playground.disableProxy`
    setting in your `mint.json`, as described in the [API Configurations documentation](/settings/global#api-configurations). 
    Note that this approach requires CORS configuration on your server since requests will come directly
    from users' browsers.
