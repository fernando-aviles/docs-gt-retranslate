Here are common issues and solutions for API References:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    Likely causes: Mintlify can't find your OpenAPI document or it's invalid.

    To verify:
    1. Run `mintlify dev` locally
    2. Validate your OpenAPI document at [apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/)
    3. Ensure you're not using OpenAPI 2.0 (use [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) to convert to OpenAPI 3)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    Common causes:
    - Mismatched paths in metadata and OpenAPI document (check for exact matches, including slashes)
    - Incorrect OpenAPI document filename reference

    Example:
```md
---
openapi: "GET /users/{id}/" # Path must exactly match OpenAPI document
---
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    Solutions:
    - If using custom domain: Configure reverse proxy to allow POST requests to `/api/request`
    - Alternative: Set `api.playground.disableProxy` in `mint.json` to send requests directly (requires CORS configuration)
