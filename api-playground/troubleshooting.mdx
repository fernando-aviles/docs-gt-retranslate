API pages can be complex, and there are several common issues you might encounter. Here's a list of problems our customers frequently experience and their solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    If you're experiencing this issue, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mintlify dev` locally should help identify these issues.

    To verify that your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package that Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents. If your document
    passes validation here, the problem likely lies elsewhere.

    Note: Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you may encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) by following these steps:
    1. Go to Edit
    2. Select "Convert to OpenAPI 3"

  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This issue typically occurs when the `openapi` field in the page metadata is misspelled. Ensure
    that the HTTP method and path match exactly with those in the OpenAPI document.

    Here's an example of a common mismatch:

```md get-user.mdx
---
openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
---
```

```yaml openapi.yaml
paths:
  "/users/{id}":
    get: ...
```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, while the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. When specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, verify that the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata should look like this:

```md api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
---
openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
---
```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this might be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground begin with a `POST` request to the
    `/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, all of these requests will fail. To resolve this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

    If your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you have an alternative solution.
    You can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend using the `api.playground.disableProxy`
    setting in the `docs.json`, as described in our [configuration documentation](/settings/global#api-configurations).
    Please note that this approach will likely require you to configure CORS on your server, as these requests
    will now come directly from your users' browsers.
