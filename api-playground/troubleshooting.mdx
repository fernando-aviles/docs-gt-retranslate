Common issues and solutions for API pages:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All OpenAPI pages are blank">
    This usually means Mintlify can't find your OpenAPI document or it's invalid.

    To validate your OpenAPI document:
    1. Use the [validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/)
    2. Select "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it!"

    Note: Mintlify doesn't support OpenAPI 2.0. Convert to OpenAPI 3 at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) using Edit > Convert to OpenAPI 3.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Single OpenAPI page is blank">
    Check that your `openapi` field in page metadata exactly matches the OpenAPI document:
    - HTTP method and path must match exactly
    - Watch for trailing slashes
    - Verify OpenAPI document filename if specified

```md Example
---
openapi: "GET /users/{id}"  # Must match OpenAPI path exactly
---
```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Playground requests fail">
    For custom domains:
    - Ensure your reverse proxy allows `POST` requests to `/api/request`
    - Alternatively, use `api.playground.disableProxy` in `mint.json` to bypass proxy
    - Note: Direct requests require CORS configuration on your server
