Mintlify generates an API playground, request examples, and response examples from your endpoint definitions. Here's how to set it up:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API">
    Add your API configuration to `mint.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "https://mintlify.com/api",
        "auth": {
          "method": "bearer"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    To hide the API playground, use:
    ```json
    {
      "api": {
        "playground": {
          "mode": "hide"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create endpoint pages">
    Create an MDX file for each endpoint with the required metadata:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST /user'
    ---
    ```

    For paths with parameters, use `{}`:
    ```bash
    /v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to navigation">
    Include your endpoint pages in the `navigation` field of `mint.json`.
