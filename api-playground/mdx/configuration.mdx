Mintlify helps you create beautiful API documentation using MDX (Markdown + JSX). This guide will show you how to set up your API endpoints step by step.

## Basic Setup

Let's start with the simplest configuration possible:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API endpoint page">
    Create a new MDX file for your API endpoint. At the top, add these basic details:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'List All Users'
    api: 'GET /users'
    ---
    ```

    That's all you need to get started! This will create a basic API documentation page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add it to your navigation">
    Add your new page to the `navigation` section in your `docs.json` file:

    ```json
    {
      "navigation": [
        {
          "group": "API Reference",
          "pages": ["api-reference/list-users"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can add more features to your API documentation.

### Setting Up Your API Configuration

In your `docs.json` file, you can define global settings for all your API endpoints:

<CodeGroup>
```json Basic Configuration
{
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "server": "https://api.example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

```json Multiple Base URLs
{
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "server": [
        "https://api.example.com",
        "https://api-staging.example.com"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Adding Authentication

<Note>
  Authentication settings let your users test API endpoints with their own API keys.
</Note>

Add authentication settings to your `docs.json`:

```json
{
  "api": {
    "mdx": {
      "server": "https://api.example.com",
      "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "x-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Path Parameters

You can include path parameters in your API endpoints using curly braces:

```md
---
title: 'Get User Details'
api: 'GET /users/{userId}'
---
```

<Tip>
  When you have `server` configured in docs.json, you can use shorter paths like `/users` instead of full URLs.
</Tip>

### Customizing the API Playground

The API playground lets users test your endpoints directly in the documentation. You can control its display:

<CodeGroup>
```json Hide Playground Everywhere
{
  "api": {
    "playground": {
      "display": "none"
    }
  }
}
```

```md Hide Playground on One Page
---
title: 'Create User'
api: 'POST /users'
playground: 'none'
---
```
</CodeGroup>
