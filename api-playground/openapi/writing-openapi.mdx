## Getting Started with OpenAPI

To get started with OpenAPI, we recommend using [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) to learn the basics and [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to write your specifications.

<Note>
  We support OpenAPI v3.1. For differences between v3.0 and v3.1, see [OpenAPI's migration guide](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).

## Essential Components

### Base URL Configuration
- Use the `servers` field to specify your API's base URL
- Multiple servers can be defined for different environments
- Required for using Mintlify's API Playground features

### Authentication Setup
- Define authentication methods using `securitySchemes`
- Common types include Basic, Bearer, and API Keys
- Apply authentication using the `security` field
- Can be configured globally or per-endpoint

For detailed OpenAPI syntax and examples, refer to the [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md).
