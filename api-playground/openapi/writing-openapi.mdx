## Getting Started with OpenAPI

To help you write your OpenAPI documentation, here are essential resources:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn OpenAPI syntax
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - Try out examples
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Debug your OpenAPI document

## Base URL Configuration

Use the `servers` field to specify your API's base URL. This is required for the API Playground feature to work. Without it, the API Playground will run in simple mode only.

## Authentication Setup

Most APIs require authentication. OpenAPI supports common types like:
- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Tokens
- API Keys

Define authentication methods using `securitySchemes` and apply them with the `security` field. Check [Swagger's authentication guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for detailed examples.

The API Playground will automatically include authentication fields based on your security configurations.
