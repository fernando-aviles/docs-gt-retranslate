## Getting Started with OpenAPI

To use OpenAPI in your Mintlify documentation, you'll need to focus on two main components:

1. **Base URL Configuration**
- Add a `servers` field to specify your API's base URL
- This enables the API Playground feature
- Without a server URL, the API Playground will run in simple mode

2. **Authentication Setup**
- Define your authentication methods using `securitySchemes`
- Common types include Basic, Bearer, and API Keys
- Apply authentication using the `security` field

<Note>
  For detailed OpenAPI syntax and examples, we recommend using [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and referring to the [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md).
