## Describing your API

Need help writing OpenAPI docs? Here are essential resources:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn OpenAPI syntax
- [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) - Official documentation
- [Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Debug your OpenAPI docs
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - See live examples

<Note>
  Most examples use OpenAPI v3.0, but they work with v3.1. See the key differences [here](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).

## Base URLs

Set your API's base URL using the `servers` field. This enables features like the API Playground. Multiple servers will show as a dropdown in the playground. Without a server URL, the playground runs in simple mode.

Need different URLs for specific endpoints? You can override the server URL at the path or operation level.

## Authentication

Configure API authentication using `securitySchemes` and `security` fields. OpenAPI supports:
- Basic auth
- Bearer tokens
- API keys

The API Playground automatically adds auth fields based on your security config. You can set different auth methods for specific endpoints by overriding the security field at the operation level.

Check out [Swagger's auth docs](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for examples.
