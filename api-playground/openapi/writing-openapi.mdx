## Describing your API

Here are essential resources for working with OpenAPI:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn OpenAPI syntax
- [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) - Official specification
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Debug your OpenAPI document
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - See examples in action

<Note>
  While Swagger's Guide covers OpenAPI v3.0, it's mostly applicable to v3.1. See differences in [OpenAPI's blog](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).

## API Configuration

### Base URL
- Use the `servers` field to specify your API's base URL
- Required for Mintlify's API Playground functionality
- Multiple servers create a dropdown in the playground
- Can be overridden per path or operation

### Authentication
- Define auth methods using `securitySchemes`
- Supports Basic, Bearer, and API Key authentication
- Apply auth using the `security` field
- Can be configured globally or per operation

For detailed guidance, refer to [Swagger's documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/).
