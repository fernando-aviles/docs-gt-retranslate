## Getting Started with OpenAPI

To write OpenAPI documentation, you can use these helpful tools:
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - Create and test your OpenAPI docs
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Check your OpenAPI document for errors

<Note>
  New to OpenAPI? Start with [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) to learn the basics.

## Setting Up Your API URL

To use the API Playground, you'll need to set up your API's base URL:

1. Use the `servers` field to specify your API's base URL
2. This URL will be combined with endpoint paths like `/users` or `/products`
3. You can specify multiple servers, and users can switch between them in the API Playground

## Adding Authentication

Most APIs need authentication. Here's how to set it up:

1. Use `securitySchemes` to define your authentication methods
2. Common types include:
   - Basic Authentication
   - Bearer tokens
   - API Keys
3. Apply authentication using the `security` field

The API Playground will automatically add the proper authentication fields based on your configuration.

<Note>
  Different endpoints can use different URLs or authentication methods. You can override these settings for specific operations in your OpenAPI document.
