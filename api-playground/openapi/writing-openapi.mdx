## Getting Started with OpenAPI

Want to learn how to write OpenAPI documents? Here are the best tools to help you get started:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn the basics of OpenAPI
- [OpenAPI v3.1.0 Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.1.0.md) - Full details about the latest version
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Check your OpenAPI document for errors
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - See working examples in action

<Note>
  Most of Swagger's OpenAPI Guide covers version 3.0, but it works for v3.1 too. Want to know what changed between versions? Check out [OpenAPI's blog post](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).

## Setting Up Your API's Web Address

Every API has a base web address (URL) where it lives. In OpenAPI, you set this using the `servers` field. You'll need this for features like the API Playground to work. Learn how to set up your server URL by reading the [Swagger documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

When you use the API Playground, it will use these server URLs to send requests. If you list multiple servers, you'll see a dropdown menu to switch between them. Without a server URL, the API Playground will only work in simple mode and won't send real requests.

Does your API use different web addresses for different features? No problem! You can [set different server URLs](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/#:~:text=%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%2D%20southeastasia-,Overriding%20Servers,-The%20global%20servers) for specific parts of your API.

## Setting Up Security

Most APIs need users to prove who they are before they can use them. This is called authentication. OpenAPI lets you set this up using the `securitySchemes` field. It supports common security methods like:
- [Basic Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/) (username and password)
- [Bearer Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) (using tokens)
- [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/)

To use these security methods in your API, you'll need the `security` field. Since this can be tricky to set up, check out [Swagger's guide to authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for help and examples.

The API Playground will automatically add the right security fields based on your OpenAPI settings.

Need different security for different parts of your API? You can [set different security requirements](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for specific operations.
