## Getting Started with OpenAPI

To write effective OpenAPI documentation, you can use these helpful resources:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn OpenAPI syntax
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - Try out examples
- [Swagger & OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Debug your OpenAPI document

## Key Components

### Base URL Configuration
Use the `servers` field to specify your API's base URL. This is required for the API Playground to work properly. Multiple servers can be specified to allow switching between environments.

### Authentication
Define your API's authentication methods using the `securitySchemes` field. Common types include:
- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Authentication
- API Keys

Apply authentication to your endpoints using the `security` field. Find detailed examples in [Swagger's authentication guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/).
