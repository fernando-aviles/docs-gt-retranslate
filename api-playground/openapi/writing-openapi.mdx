## Getting Started with OpenAPI

For help creating OpenAPI documents, we recommend these resources:
- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) - Learn OpenAPI syntax
- [Swagger's Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) - See examples and test your specs
- [OpenAPI Validator](https://apitools.dev/swagger-parser/online/) - Debug your OpenAPI document

<Note>
  Most OpenAPI guides reference v3.0, which is largely compatible with v3.1. See the differences in [OpenAPI's migration guide](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0).

## Essential Configuration

### Base URLs
Define your API's base URL using the `servers` field. This is required for the API Playground to send requests. Multiple servers will show as a dropdown in the playground. Learn more about [server configuration](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/).

### Authentication
Configure API authentication using `securitySchemes` and `security` fields. Common types include:
- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Tokens
- API Keys

Check [Swagger's authentication guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) for setup examples.

Both server URLs and authentication can be overridden for specific endpoints if needed.
