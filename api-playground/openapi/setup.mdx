## Add your OpenAPI specification

To get started, make sure you have a valid OpenAPI 3.0+ document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

## Set up API Documentation

There are two main ways to document your API with OpenAPI:

### 1. Auto-generate API Pages (Recommended)

The simplest way to get started is by adding an `openapi` field to your `mint.json`. This can be either a local path or URL to your OpenAPI document.

```json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will automatically generate pages for all your API endpoints with:
- Titles from the OpenAPI operation summaries
- Descriptions from the OpenAPI operation details
- Version information when specified

### 2. Custom MDX Pages

For more control over your API documentation, you can create individual MDX pages for each endpoint. You can either:

1. Auto-generate the MDX files using our scraper:
```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

2. Create pages manually by referencing OpenAPI operations:
```md
---
title: "Get users"
openapi: "GET /users"
---
```

<Note>
  If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the full path in the openapi reference:
  `openapi: "/path/to/openapi.json GET /users"`
</Note>

## OpenAPI Schemas

To create pages for your OpenAPI schemas, use the `openapi-schema` field in your MDX files:

```md
---
openapi-schema: "SchemaName"
---
```
