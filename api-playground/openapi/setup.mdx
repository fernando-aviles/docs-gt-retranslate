## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To get started, you need a valid OpenAPI document (version 3.0+) in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/).

<Tip>To validate your OpenAPI spec, use: `mintlify openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`</Tip>

## Add OpenAPI to Your Docs

There are two main ways to include OpenAPI documentation:

### 1. Auto-populate API pages

Add an `openapi` field to your `mint.json` to automatically generate pages for each OpenAPI operation. You can specify either a local path or URL to your OpenAPI document:

```json
{
  "anchors": [
    {
      "name": "API Reference",
      "openapi": "/path/to/openapi.json",
      "url": "api-reference",
      "icon": "square-terminal"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Create Custom API Pages

For more control over your API documentation, you can create individual MDX pages for each operation:

#### Autogenerate MDX Files
Use our scraper to generate MDX files from your OpenAPI document:

```bash
npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
```

#### Manual Creation
Create MDX files manually by referencing OpenAPI operations in the page metadata:

```md
---
title: "Get users"
openapi: "GET /users"
---
```

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, specify the path:
```md
---
title: "Get users"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi.json GET /users"
---
```

<Note>
  The method and path must exactly match what's specified in your OpenAPI document.
</Note>

You can also create pages for OpenAPI schemas defined in `components.schemas`:

```md
---
openapi-schema: "SchemaName"
---
```
