OpenAPI 3 offers several advanced ways to describe complex APIs. Let's explore how to use these features with Mintlify.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf`

OpenAPI provides three special keywords to help you work with complex data types: `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf`. These keywords let you combine different data structures. Here's what each one does:

- `oneOf`: Means "pick exactly one option from the list"
- `anyOf`: Means "pick one or more options from the list"
- `allOf`: Means "include everything from all options"

<Warning>In Mintlify, we handle `oneOf` and `anyOf` the same way. We've found that most developers use these terms interchangeably, and the difference rarely matters to users.</Warning>

<Info>Note: Mintlify doesn't support the `not` keyword at this time.</Info>

### Using `allOf` to Combine Data Structures

Mintlify makes it easy to read combined data structures. For example, when you join two objects with `allOf`, we show all their properties together in one place. This is especially helpful when you're using [reusable components in OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/).

```yaml
org_with_users:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Org'
    - type: object
      properties:
        users:
          type: array
          description: An array containing all users in the organization
...
components:
  schemas:
    Org:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: The ID of the organization
```

<ParamField body="org_with_users" type="object">
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The ID of the organization
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="users" type="object[]">
      An array containing all users in the organization
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Offering Choices with `oneOf` and `anyOf`

When you use `oneOf` or `anyOf`, Mintlify shows the options in tabs. To make these tabs easy to understand, give each option a clear title. Here's an example showing two different ways to write a delivery address:

```yaml
delivery_address:
  oneOf:
    - title: StreetAddress
      type: object
      properties:
        address_line_1:
          type: string
          description: The street address of the recipient
        ...
    - title: POBox
      type: object
      properties:
        box_number:
          type: string
          description: The number of the PO Box
        ...
```

<ParamField body="delivery_address" type="object">
  <div className="mt-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-100 px-4 pb-4 pt-2 dark:border-white/10">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="StreetAddress">
        <ParamField body="address_line_1" type="string">
          The street address of the residence
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="POBox">
        <ParamField body="box_number" type="string">
          The number of the PO Box
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</ParamField>

## `x-codeSamples`

If your users work with your API through an SDK instead of direct API calls, you can add example code to your documentation. Use the `x-codeSamples` feature to add these examples. You can add this to any API endpoint, and it needs:

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The programming language used in the example
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  A name for the example (helpful when you have multiple examples)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The actual code for the example
</ParamField>

Here's an example from a plant tracking app that has both a command-line tool and a JavaScript SDK:

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```
