The API playground lets you test API endpoints right from the documentation without writing any code. Think of it as a built-in Postman that's always ready to go.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an API endpoint">
    Browse through the documentation to find the API endpoint you want to test. Each endpoint will have an interactive playground section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in the parameters">
    The playground automatically shows all the required fields you need to fill in:
    - Path parameters (like IDs in the URL)
    - Query parameters 
    - Request body fields
    
    <Note>
      Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*)
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send the request">
    Click the "Try It" button to make a real API call. You'll see:
    - The complete request that was sent
    - The response you got back
    - Response status code
    - Response headers
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage

Here's what you'll typically see in the playground:

## Automatic Generation

The playground is automatically generated from our OpenAPI specification, ensuring it's always up to date with the latest API changes.

<Note>
  Can't see the playground for an endpoint? Make sure the endpoint is properly defined in the OpenAPI specification.
