## What is the API Playground?

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test your API endpoints directly from your documentation. Think of it as a built-in API testing tool where users can:

- Make real API requests
- See exactly how the API behaves
- Test different parameters and inputs
- View formatted responses

## Getting Started

The easiest way to add API playground to your docs is by using OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger). When you use OpenAPI:

1. The playground is automatically generated for each endpoint
2. All parameters and response formats are pre-configured
3. Authentication is handled automatically

  Want to add API playground using OpenAPI? Check out our [OpenAPI setup guide](/api-playground/openapi) for step-by-step instructions.

Don't have an OpenAPI specification? No problem! You can also set up the playground manually for each endpoint. We'll walk you through that in our [manual configuration guide](/api-playground/mdx).

## Example

Here's an example of what an API playground looks like when set up. Try making a request below:

This is a live API playground example. Feel free to:
- Change the parameters
- Click "Send API Request"
- See the actual response
