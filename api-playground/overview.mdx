The API Playground lets you test API endpoints right from your documentation. Think of it as a built-in API testing tool - no need to switch to Postman or other external tools!

## What Can You Do in the Playground?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test Endpoints" icon="vial">
    Make real API calls and see responses instantly
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fill Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Input your own values for path, query, and body parameters
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authenticate" icon="key">
    Add your API keys and authentication tokens
  </Card>
  <Card title="View Responses" icon="code">
    See formatted API responses with syntax highlighting
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

The playground appears automatically on API documentation pages. Here's what you'll typically see:

1. **Authentication Fields** - Where you enter API keys or tokens
2. **Parameter Inputs** - Fields to enter your request data
3. **Try It Button** - Click to make the API call
4. **Response Section** - Shows the API response after your call

<Note>
  If you're using OpenAPI to document your API, the playground will be generated automatically!

## Tips for Using the Playground

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Save Time with Default Values" icon="clock">
    The playground will pre-fill example values from your OpenAPI spec, making it faster to test endpoints.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test Different Scenarios" icon="flask">
    Try various parameter combinations to see how the API responds in different situations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Check Error Responses" icon="bug">
    Intentionally send invalid data to see how error responses look and understand error handling.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Keep your API keys handy! You'll need them to make authenticated requests in the playground.
