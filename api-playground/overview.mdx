## What is the API Playground?

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets you test API endpoints directly in your documentation. Instead of copy-pasting code or using external tools, you can make API calls and see responses right on the page.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Testing**: Make API requests and see responses instantly
- **Authentication Support**: Securely test endpoints that require authentication 
- **Parameter Editor**: Easily modify query parameters, headers, and request bodies
- **Response Viewer**: See formatted API responses with syntax highlighting
- **Code Snippets**: Get example code in multiple programming languages

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an API endpoint">
    Navigate to any API reference page in the documentation to see the interactive playground.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure parameters">
    Fill in any required parameters, headers, or request body fields in the playground interface.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send a request">
    Click the "Send API Request" button to test the endpoint and see the response.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View results">
    The response will appear below, showing the status code, headers, and formatted response body.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If you've configured your API documentation using OpenAPI (formerly Swagger), the API playground will be automatically generated for each endpoint. Learn more about using OpenAPI with Mintlify [here](/api-playground/openapi).

## Example Playground

Here's an example of what the playground looks like in action:

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden" src="/images/api-playground-example-light.png" alt="API Playground Demo" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/api-playground-example-dark.png" alt="API Playground Demo" />
</Frame>

The playground includes:
1. Method selector and endpoint URL
2. Authentication settings (if required)
3. Parameter inputs
4. Request body editor (for POST/PUT requests)
5. Response viewer
6. Code snippet generator

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an API key to use the playground?">
    If the API endpoint requires authentication, you'll need the appropriate credentials (like an API key) to make successful requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I save my test configurations?">
    Currently, parameter values and configurations are not saved between sessions. We recommend keeping track of commonly used test values separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are there any request limitations?">
    The playground follows the same rate limits and restrictions as your API. Make sure to check your API's documentation for specific limitations.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  You can customize how the API playground appears in your documentation using global settings. See the [API playground configuration guide](/api-playground/configuration) for more details.
