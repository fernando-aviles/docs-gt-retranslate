## Best Practices

### Content Optimization

- **Review content before export**: Ensure all pages are complete and up-to-date
- **Optimize images**: Use high-quality images that will render well in PDF format
- **Check code blocks**: Verify that code snippets are properly formatted and readable
- **Test internal links**: Ensure cross-references work correctly in the PDF output

### PDF Structure

- **Consistent formatting**: Use consistent heading styles throughout your documentation
- **Page breaks**: Consider manual page breaks for better PDF flow
- **Table of contents**: Enable TOC generation for easier navigation

### Performance Considerations

- **Large documentation sites**: Consider splitting very large sites into multiple PDFs
- **Image optimization**: Compress images to reduce PDF file size
- **Processing time**: Allow adequate time for large documentation exports
- **Resource usage**: Schedule exports during off-peak hours for better performance

## Limitations and Considerations
