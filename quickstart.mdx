## Choose your editing style

Pick the workflow that matches how you like to work:

<Card title="Developer workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#developer-workflow">
  Work locally with your favorite code editor and Git workflow.
</Card>

<Card title="Visual editor" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#visual-editor">
  Edit directly in your browser with a rich visual interface.
</Card>

## Developer workflow

Perfect for teams who want to manage docs alongside their codebase using familiar development tools.

### Set up the CLI

Install the Mintlify CLI to work with your docs locally:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Requires Node.js v19 or higher. Having trouble? Check our troubleshooting section below.
</Info>

### Make your first edit

Let's update your homepage to see the workflow in action:

1. Clone the repository created during setup
2. Open `index.mdx` and find the frontmatter:

```mdx index.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

3. Change the title to something personal:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Welcome to our docs"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Test locally

Preview your changes before publishing:

```bash
mint dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` to see your site running locally.

git commit -m "Update homepage title"
git push
```

Mintlify detects your changes and automatically rebuilds your site. Track the deployment in your GitHub Actions or [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

## Custom domain

Replace your `.mintlify.app` URL with your own branded domain for a professional look.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Enter your desired domain (like `docs.yourcompany.com`) and configure these DNS records with your domain provider:

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or your subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
