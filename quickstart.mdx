## Getting Started

Hey there! Let's walk through how to set up, update, and make your documentation amazing with Mintlify.

### Setting Up Your Documentation

Mintlify creates documentation from MDX files (special markdown files) and settings in our [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). We use GitHub to keep your docs connected with your code. To begin, you can either:
- Sign up through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com), or
- Copy our [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter)

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Set up the GitHub app">
  
    To make sure your changes show up automatically, you'll need to install our GitHub app. You can find it in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) under Settings. Once it's installed correctly, you'll see a check mark next to your repository's commit hash.

### Making Changes

Here's how you can customize your docs to look and work exactly how you want.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Edit on your computer (best for developers)">

    1. First, install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you haven't already.
    2. Copy your docs to your computer using `git clone <your-repo>`. New to this? Check out how to set up [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
    3. Open the files in your favorite code editor.
    4. Install our preview tool with `npm i -g mintlify`.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Match your brand's style">
  
    You can easily change colors, logos, and buttons in the `mint.json` file. Here are the basics:

    ```json
    "name": "Your Company"
    "logo": {
      "light": "/logo/light.svg",
      "dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
      "href": "https://yourcompany.com"
    },
    "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
    "colors": {
      "primary": "#2AB673",
      "light": "#55D799",
      "dark": "#117866",
    },
    ```

    See all options in our [global settings](/settings/global).

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Add new content">

    Create new pages using MDX files. Start each page with:

    ```md
    ---
    title: "Page Title"
    sidebarTitle: "Sidebar title (optional)"
    description: "Brief description (optional)"
    ---
    ```

    Learn how to add images, tables, and more in our [MDX guide](/text). We also have many [ready-to-use components](/content/components).

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Add API documentation">

    Want to document your API? It's easy with an OpenAPI file:

    1. Add your `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json` file to your docs, or link to it in `mint.json`:

    ```json
    "openapi": "link-to-your-openapi-file"
    ```

    2. Convert your OpenAPI file into docs pages:

    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-or-url-to-openapi-file>
    ```

    3. Add the new files to your navigation in `mint.json`.
