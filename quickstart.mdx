## Choose your editing workflow

Mintlify supports two distinct workflows. Pick the one that matches your team's preferences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" href="#code-based-editing">
  Perfect for developers who want to work locally with familiar tools like VS Code, Git, and the command line.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="browser" href="#web-editor-editing">
  Ideal for content creators who prefer a visual, browser-based editing experience with instant previews.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
You can switch between workflows at any time. Many teams use both depending on the type of changes they're making.
</Note>

## Code-based editing

Set up your local development environment to edit documentation with your favorite tools.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">
  Install the CLI to work with your documentation locally.
  
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install -g mint
  ```
  
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
  
  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mint
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  <Info>
  Requires Node.js version 19 or higher. Check your version with `node --version`.
  </Info>
  
  <Check>
  Verify installation by running `mint --version` in your terminal.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your documentation repository">
  Clone the repository that was created during your Mintlify onboarding.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
  cd your-docs-repo
  ```
  
  <Check>
  You should see files like `docs.json`, `index.mdx`, and other documentation files in the repository.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Start the local development server">
  Preview your documentation site locally while you make changes.
  
  ```bash
  mint dev
  ```
  
  Your site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
  
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-light.png" alt="Local development server running in terminal" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-dark.png" alt="Local development server running in terminal" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  <Tip>
  The development server automatically reloads when you save changes to your files.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Make your first edit">
  Update the homepage to see the editing workflow in action.
  
  1. Open `index.mdx` in your code editor
  2. Find the frontmatter at the top of the file:
     
     ```mdx index.mdx
     ---
     title: "Introduction"
     description: "Welcome to our documentation"
     ---
     ```
  
  3. Change the title to something personal:
     
     ```mdx index.mdx {2}
     ---
     title: "Welcome to Mintlify"
     description: "Your beautiful documentation starts here"
     ---
     ```
  
  4. Save the file and check your local preview
  
  <Check>
  Your changes should appear immediately at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy your changes">
  Push your changes to see them live on your documentation site.
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update homepage title"
  git push origin main
  ```
  
  Mintlify automatically builds and deploys your changes. This typically takes 1-2 minutes.

## Add a custom domain

Replace your `.mintlify.app` domain with your own branded domain.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access domain settings">
  Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure your domain">
  Enter your desired domain (e.g., `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the DNS instructions.
  
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom domain configuration interface" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom domain configuration interface" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  Add this CNAME record with your DNS provider:
  
  | Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
  |-------------|------|-------|-----|
  | CNAME | docs (or your subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Step>

<Step title="Verify domain connection">
  DNS changes typically take 5-15 minutes but can take up to 48 hours.
  
  <Info>
  Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record is propagating correctly.
  </Info>
  
  <Check>
  When configured correctly, your documentation will be available at your custom domain.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Run into issues? Here are solutions to the most common problems:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Local preview isn't working">
**Check Node.js version**: Ensure you have Node.js v19+ installed (`node --version`)

**Verify file location**: Run `mint dev` from the directory containing your `docs.json` file

**Clear cache**: Try `mint dev --clean` if you see build errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes aren't appearing on live site">
**Check deployment status**: Visit your GitHub repository's Actions tab to see build status

**Wait for deployment**: Deployments can take 2-3 minutes to complete

**Clear browser cache**: Hard refresh your browser (`Ctrl+F5` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GitHub App permissions issues">
**Update repository access**: Go to GitHub Settings → Applications → Mintlify and adjust repository permissions

**Re-authorize account**: Try disconnecting and reconnecting your GitHub account in Mintlify settings
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
**Verify DNS records**: Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to confirm your CNAME record

**Allow propagation time**: DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate

**Check subdomain**: Ensure you're using the correct subdomain (e.g., `docs` not `www`)
