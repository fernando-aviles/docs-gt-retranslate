## Choose your editing workflow

Mintlify supports two workflows for creating and maintaining documentation. Choose the one that best fits your team's preferences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" href="#code-based-workflow">
  Work with your favorite editor and Git workflow. Perfect for developers who want to manage docs alongside code.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" href="#web-editor-workflow">
  Visual browser-based editing with instant preview. Great for writers and teams who prefer a WYSIWYG experience.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Code-based workflow

Integrate documentation into your existing development environment with local editing and Git-based publishing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the CLI">
  Install the Mintlify CLI to preview changes locally before publishing.
  
  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm install -g mint
  ```
  
  ```bash pnpm  
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
  
  ```bash yarn
  yarn global add mint
  ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  <Info>
  Requires Node.js v19 or higher. Check your version with `node --version`.
  </Info>
  
  <Check>
  Verify installation by running `mint --version` in your terminal.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Clone your repository">
  Get your documentation repository on your local machine.
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-docs-repo.git
  cd your-docs-repo
  ```
  
  <Check>
  Your repository contains a `docs.json` configuration file and sample MDX pages.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Make your first edit">
  Let's update the homepage to verify everything works correctly.
  
  Open `index.mdx` in your favorite editor and update the frontmatter:
  
  ```mdx index.mdx
  ---
  title: "Welcome to our docs"
  description: "Your gateway to everything you need to know"
  ---
  
  # Hello World
  
  This is your first documentation page. You can edit this content and see changes immediately.
  ```
  
  <Tip>
  Use descriptive titles and descriptions—they improve SEO and help users understand your content.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Preview locally">
  Start the development server to see your changes in real-time.
  
  ```bash
  mint dev
  ```
  
  Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview your site.
  
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-light.png" alt="Local development server showing the documentation preview" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-dark.png" alt="Local development server showing the documentation preview" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  <Check>
  Your changes appear instantly in the browser. The development server automatically reloads when you save files.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Publish your changes">
  When you're ready to go live, commit and push your changes.
  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update homepage content"
  git push origin main
  ```
  
  <Check>
  Within 2-3 minutes, your changes will be live at `your-project-name.mintlify.app`. Check your dashboard for deployment status.

## Web editor workflow

Edit your documentation directly in your browser with a visual interface and instant publishing.

<Steps>
<Step title="Access the web editor">
  Navigate to the **Editor** section in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  
  <Info>

  </Info>
  
  <Frame>
    <img alt="Web editor interface showing the file browser and editing area" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img alt="Web editor interface showing the file browser and editing area" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  <Check>
  The editor loads your documentation files with a live preview alongside your editing area.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Edit your content">
  Select `index.mdx` from the file browser and update the content in the editor.
  
  <Frame>
    <img alt="Editing content in the web editor with live preview" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-light.png" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img alt="Editing content in the web editor with live preview" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  <Tip>
  Use the command menu (type `/`) to quickly insert components like callouts, code blocks, and tables.
  </Tip>
  
  <Check>
  Changes appear instantly in the preview panel, so you can see exactly how your content will look.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Publish instantly">
  Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner to deploy your changes immediately.
  
  <Warning>
  Publishing directly updates your live site. Use branches for collaborative editing and review workflows.
  </Warning>
  
  <Check>
  Your changes are live within seconds. No build process or waiting required.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For team collaboration, create branches in the web editor to preview changes before publishing. Learn more in our [web editor guide](/editor/getting-started).
</Tip>

## Set up custom domain

Replace your `mintlify.app` subdomain with your own branded domain for a professional documentation site.

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure your domain">
  Navigate to **Settings** → **Deployment** → **Custom Domain** in your dashboard.
  
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom domain configuration interface" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom domain configuration interface" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
  
  Enter your desired domain (like `docs.yourcompany.com`).
</Step>

<Step title="Update DNS settings">
  Add a CNAME record with your domain provider using these values:
  
  | Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
  |-------------|------|-------|-----|
  | CNAME | docs (or your subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
  
  <Info>
  DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours, but typically completes within a few hours.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
  Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record is properly configured across DNS servers.
  
  <Check>
  Once DNS propagates, your documentation will be available at your custom domain with automatic HTTPS.
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common issues and solutions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Local preview isn't working">
**Check these common causes:**
- Ensure Node.js v19+ is installed (`node --version`)
- Run `mint dev` from the directory containing your `docs.json` file
- Check that port 3000 isn't already in use

If issues persist, try clearing npm cache with `npm cache clean --force` and reinstalling: `npm install -g mint`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes aren't appearing on live site">
**Deployment troubleshooting:**
- Check deployment status in your dashboard or GitHub Actions tab
- Verify your GitHub App has access to the correct repository  
- Look for build errors in the deployment logs
- Deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes; wait before troubleshooting

**Common build errors:**
- Invalid MDX syntax in content files
- Missing or malformed `docs.json` configuration
- Broken links to internal pages or images
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
**DNS configuration checklist:**
- Verify CNAME record points to `cname.mintlify.app`
- Ensure TTL is set to 3600 or lower for faster propagation
- Check record is applied to the correct subdomain (usually `docs`)
- Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation globally

**If domain still isn't working:**
- Contact your DNS provider for propagation status
- Ensure no conflicting A records exist for the same subdomain
- Try using a different subdomain temporarily to test configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="GitHub App permissions issues">
**Permission problems:**
- Reinstall the GitHub App with access to your documentation repository
- Verify you have admin access to the repository
- Check organization settings don't block third-party applications  
- Re-authorize your GitHub account in **Settings** → **My Profile**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Web editor not loading">
**Editor troubleshooting:**
- Clear browser cache and cookies for the Mintlify domain
- Disable browser extensions that might block the editor
- Ensure the GitHub App is installed with repository access
- Try using an incognito/private browsing window
</Accordion>
