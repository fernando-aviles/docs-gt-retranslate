Transform your documentation into a beautiful, searchable site that your users will love. This guide walks you through creating your first Mintlify documentation site and making your first edit.

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- A live documentation site with your custom content
- Two workflow options for editing and publishing
- A custom domain (optional but recommended)

<Info>
**Ready to start?** You'll need a [Mintlify account](https://mintlify.com/start) and a GitHub account to continue.
</Info>

## Create your documentation site

After creating your Mintlify account, you'll automatically get a starter documentation site deployed to a unique URL:

```
https://spearmint-docs.mintlify.app
```

<Check>
Your site is live immediately! Find your exact URL in your [dashboard overview](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).
</Check>

## Connect your GitHub repository

Mintlify automatically creates a GitHub repository with your starter documentation. To enable automatic deployments when you make changes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the GitHub App">
  Navigate to **Settings** → **GitHub App** in your dashboard, then select **Install GitHub App**.
  
  <Check>
  The GitHub App installation page opens in a new tab with pre-selected repositories.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure repository access">
  Select your organization and choose which repositories the app can access. For most users, selecting "Selected repositories" and choosing your documentation repository is sufficient.

  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Authorize your GitHub account">
  Return to your dashboard and navigate to **Settings** → **My Profile**, then select **Authorize GitHub account**.
  
  <Warning>
  Organization owners may need to approve third-party app access depending on your GitHub organization settings.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Choose your editing workflow

Mintlify supports two distinct workflows for creating and maintaining documentation. Choose the one that fits your team's preferences:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" href="#code-workflow">
  Edit with your favorite code editor, preview locally, and deploy via Git. Perfect for technical teams who want documentation alongside code.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" href="#web-editor-workflow">  
  Edit directly in your browser with a visual interface. Ideal for non-technical team members or quick updates.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Code workflow

The code-based workflow integrates seamlessly with your existing development tools and Git workflow.

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone your repository">
  Clone the repository that Mintlify created during onboarding:
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/mintlify-docs.git
  cd mintlify-docs
  ```
  
  <Check>
  You should see files like `docs.json`, `index.mdx`, and other starter content.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Install the Mintlify CLI">
  Install the CLI to preview changes locally:
  
  <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install -g mint
    ```
    
    ```bash pnpm  
    pnpm add -g mint
    ```
    
    ```bash yarn
    yarn global add mint
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
  
  <Info>
  Requires Node.js v18 or higher. Run `node --version` to check your current version.

## Add a custom domain

Replace your temporary `mintlify.app` subdomain with a professional custom domain for production use.

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure your domain">
  Navigate to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard and enter your desired subdomain:
  
  ```
  docs.wintergreen.com
  ```
  
  <Frame caption="Domain configuration interface showing DNS instructions">
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom domain setup page with DNS configuration instructions" className="block dark:hidden" />
    <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom domain setup page with DNS configuration instructions" className="hidden dark:block" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Update DNS settings">
  Add this CNAME record with your domain provider:
  
  | Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
  |-------------|------|-------|-----|
  | CNAME | docs | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
  
  <Info>
  DNS propagation typically takes 15 minutes to 4 hours, though it can take up to 48 hours in rare cases.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify setup">
  Once DNS propagates, your documentation will be available at your custom domain with automatic HTTPS.
  
  <Check>
  Use [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record is propagated globally.
  </Check>
</Step>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Local preview isn't starting">
**Problem**: `mint dev` command fails or doesn't open localhost:3000

**Solutions**:
- Verify Node.js v18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Ensure you're in the directory containing `docs.json`
- Check if port 3000 is already in use: `lsof -i :3000`
- Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes aren't appearing on live site">
**Problem**: Pushed changes don't reflect on your documentation site

**Solutions**:
- Check [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/actions) for build errors
