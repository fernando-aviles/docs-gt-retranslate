## Welcome to Mintlify

Get your documentation site up and running in just a few minutes with this quickstart guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A GitHub account
- Basic familiarity with Markdown
- Your documentation content ready

## Step 1: Create your documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize your project">
    Start by creating a new repository or using an existing one for your documentation.
    
    ```bash
    mkdir my-docs
    cd my-docs
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your first page">
    Create an `index.mdx` file in your project root:
    
    ```mdx index.mdx
    ---
    title: Welcome
    description: Welcome to my documentation
    ---
    
    # Welcome to my docs
    
    This is your first documentation page.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure navigation">
    Create a `docs.json` file to configure your site:
    
    ```json docs.json
    {
      "name": "My Documentation",
      "navigation": {
        "pages": ["index"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
