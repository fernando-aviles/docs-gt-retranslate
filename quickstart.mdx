## Welcome to Mintlify

Build beautiful, modern documentation that your users will love. Get started in three simple steps:

1. Create your documentation repository
2. Set up your content
3. Deploy to the world

Let's walk through each step!

## Step 1: Getting Your Repository Ready

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Option A: Start with our Dashboard (Recommended)">
    The fastest way to get started is through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Just sign in and we'll help you create your first documentation repository with everything configured for you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Option B: Clone our Starter Template">
    If you prefer to set things up manually:
    1. Visit our [starter template](https://github.com/mintlify/starter)
    2. Click "Use this template" to create your own repository
    3. Clone your new repository to your computer
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Connect with GitHub

<Info>
  This step ensures your documentation automatically updates whenever you make changes.
</Info>

1. Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings)
2. Look for the GitHub app installation section
3. Click to install our GitHub app for your repository

Once installed, you'll see a green checkmark next to your repository, confirming the connection is working:

## Step 2: Adding Your Content

You have two ways to edit your documentation:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen-to-square" title="Option A: Use our Web Editor">
    Edit directly in your browser with live previews. Perfect if you want to:
    - Make quick updates
    - See changes in real-time
    - Edit without setting up locally

    [Learn how to use the web editor →](/web-editor)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Option B: Edit Locally">
    Edit files on your computer. Great if you want to:
    - Work with your favorite code editor
    - Test changes before publishing
    - Make bulk updates

    Quick setup:
    1. Install our preview tool: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run `mintlify dev` in your docs folder
    3. Open `localhost:3000` to see changes live

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Customizing Your Docs

Make the docs your own by updating the `mint.json` configuration file. Here are the essential settings to start with:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Company",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
    "href": "https://yourcompany.com"
  },
  "favicon": "/favicon.svg",
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#2AB673",
    "light": "#55D799",
    "dark": "#117866"
  }
}
```

[See all configuration options →](/settings/global)

### Creating Pages

Create new pages using simple MDX files. Start each file with this header:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "A brief description of what this page covers"
---

Your content goes here...
```

## Step 3: Publishing Your Docs

### Deploy Your Changes

Whenever you're ready to update your live documentation:

1. Commit your changes
2. Push to your repository
3. We'll automatically deploy the updates

<Note>
  If you need help deploying, you can always update manually through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
</Note>

### Add Your Custom Domain

Want your docs at your own domain (like `docs.yourcompany.com`)?

1. Go to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings)
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update your DNS settings (we'll provide the details)
