## Getting Started

Welcome! Follow these comprehensive instructions to deploy, update, and supercharge your documentation with Mintlify.

### Creating the Repository

Mintlify docs are rendered from MDX files and configurations defined in our
[starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter). We use GitHub to integrate
your docs with your code and make source control effortless.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Using the starter kit (recommended)">
    ```bash Terminal
    # Clone the starter kit
    git clone https://github.com/mintlify/starter.git my-documentation

    # Navigate to the new directory
    cd my-documentation

    # Remove the existing git history
    rm -rf .git

    # Initialize a new git repository
    git init

    # Create your first commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initialize Mintlify documentation"
    ```

    After cloning, you'll need to:
    1. Update the `docs.json` file with your project details
    2. Create a new repository on GitHub
    3. Push your code to the new repository
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install the GitHub app">
    Install our GitHub app to ensure that your updates are automatically deployed when you push changes. You can find the installation link in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings), on the Settings page.

    </Frame>

    Once installed, you'll see a check mark next to your repository's commit hash, indicating successful connection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Monorepo Setup">
    For a monorepo setup, follow these steps:

    1. Create a `docs` directory in your repository:
    ```bash
    mkdir docs
    cp -r starter/* docs/
    ```

    2. Update your repository settings in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) to specify the docs directory:

    <Frame>
      <img
        alt="Monorepo setup"
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/images/monorepo-light.png"
      />
      <img
        alt="Monorepo setup"
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/images/monorepo-dark.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Updating the Content

Mintlify provides extensive customization options for your documentation's style, structure, and content.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Local Development Setup (Recommended)">
    Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

    ```bash Terminal
    # Install the Mintlify CLI globally
    npm i -g mintlify

    # Start the development server
    mintlify dev

    # The dev server will start at http://localhost:3000
    ```

    <Note>
      You'll need Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher installed on your machine.
    </Note>

    Common development commands:
    ```bash
    # Preview your changes locally
    mintlify dev

    # Check for broken links and other issues
    mintlify check

    # Build your documentation
    mintlify build
    ```

    Learn more in our [local development guide](/development).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="palette" title="Customizing Your Documentation">
    The `docs.json` file is your central configuration hub. Here's a comprehensive example:

  <Accordion icon="pencil" title="Creating Content">
    MDX combines Markdown with JSX, allowing you to use React components in your documentation.

    Here's an example page structure:

    ```mdx
    ---
    title: "Authentication"
    description: "Learn how to authenticate with our API"
    icon: "lock"
    ---

    # Authentication

    Our API uses Bearer tokens for authentication.

    <Note>
      Keep your API keys secure and never expose them in client-side code.
    </Note>

    ## Getting Your API Key

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Navigate to the Dashboard">
        Log in to your account at dashboard.yourcompany.com
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access API Settings">
        Click on "Settings" > "API Keys"
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate New Key">
        Click "Generate New API Key" and save it securely
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    ## Making Authenticated Requests

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash cURL
      curl -X POST https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/data \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"key": "value"}'
      ```

      ```javascript Node.js
      const response = await fetch('https://api.yourcompany.com/v1/data', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ key: 'value' }),
      });
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
    ```

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Deploying Changes">
    Follow these steps to deploy your changes:

    ```bash Terminal
    # Add your changes
    git add .

    # Commit your changes
    git commit -m "Update documentation"

    # Push to your repository
    git push origin main
    ```

    <Note>
      Deployments typically take 1-2 minutes. You can monitor the status in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    </Note>

    If automatic deployment fails, you can manually trigger a deployment:

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="bug" title="Common Issues and Solutions">
    Here are solutions to common setup issues:

    1. **Development server won't start**
    ```bash
    # Clear your node_modules and reinstall
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install

    # Clear Mintlify cache
    mintlify clear
    ```

    2. **Images not loading**
    - Ensure image paths are relative to the root directory
    - Check that image files are committed to your repository
    - Verify the image format is supported (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG)

    3. **Deployment failures**
    - Verify your GitHub app is properly installed
    - Check for broken links using `mintlify check`
    - Ensure all required fields in `docs.json` are filled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Performance Optimization">
    Follow these best practices for optimal performance:

    1. Optimize images before uploading
    2. Use code splitting for large documentation sets
