  **Check these common issues:**
  - Ensure the GitHub App has access to your repository
  - Verify your `docs.json` file is valid JSON

  - Look at the commit status in GitHub for deployment errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Local preview not working">
  **Solutions to try:**
  - Make sure you have Node.js v19+ installed

  - Check that all dependencies are installed with `npm install`
  - Clear your browser cache and try again
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Changes not showing on live site">
  **Possible causes:**
  - Deployment can take a few minutes - be patient
  - Check GitHub Actions for build errors (code-based workflow)
  - Review deployment logs in your Mintlify dashboard

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom domain not connecting">
  **Troubleshooting steps:**
  - Verify DNS records are set up correctly
