## Introduction

Welcome to Mintlify! This quickstart guide will walk you through the process of setting up your documentation site. You'll learn how to deploy your docs, make updates, and enhance them with advanced features.

## Setting Up Your Repository

Before you can start building your documentation, you'll need to set up your repository. Mintlify renders documentation from MDX files and configurations defined in our starter kit.

### Choose Your Setup Method

You have two main options to get started:
1. Create a new repository through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Clone our [starter kit](https://github.com/mintlify/starter) directly

### Configure GitHub Integration

To enable automatic deployments, you'll need to set up our GitHub integration:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install GitHub App">
    Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) and locate the GitHub app installation section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Installation">
    Follow the installation prompts to give Mintlify access to your documentation repository.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Integration">
    Once installed successfully, you'll see a check mark next to your repository's commit hash.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Monorepo Configuration

If you're using a monorepo structure to keep your docs alongside your code:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Move Documentation">
    Relocate your documentation content into your monorepo structure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Settings">
    Specify your docs location in the [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings).

## Making Updates

Mintlify offers multiple ways to update your documentation. Here's an overview of the available methods and customization options:
