## Getting Started

Welcome to Mintlify! This guide will help you set up your documentation in just a few steps.

### 1. Create Your Documentation Repository

2. Install our GitHub app from your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings) to enable automatic deployments

### 2. Update Your Content

Choose your preferred editing method:

#### Development Environment (Recommended)
1. Clone your repository: `git clone <your-repo>`
2. Install Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mintlify`
3. Start local development server: `mintlify dev`

#### Web Editor
Edit directly through our web interface at [dashboard.mintlify.com](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)

### 3. Customize Your Docs

Update your `mint.json` with your brand details:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Company",
  "logo": {
    "light": "/logo/light.svg",
    "dark": "/logo/dark.svg"
  },
  "colors": {
    "primary": "#2AB673"
  }
}
```

### 4. Add Content
