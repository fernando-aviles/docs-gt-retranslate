Get your documentation site live in minutes with this step-by-step guide.

You'll go from zero to a fully deployed documentation site that's ready for your team to use and customize.

<Info>

## Launch your site

Once you finish the setup wizard, your documentation automatically goes live at:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

You can find this URL in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/) overview section.

Your site is live immediately - share this URL with your team while you build out your content.

## Developer workflow

Perfect for teams who want documentation integrated with their development process.

### Set up the CLI

Install our command-line tool to work with your docs locally:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mint
  ```

  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -g mint
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Requires Node.js v19 or higher. Having trouble? Check our troubleshooting section below.
</Info>

### Make your first edit

Let's update your homepage to see the workflow in action:

1. Clone the repository created during setup
2. Open `index.mdx` and find the frontmatter:

```mdx index.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

3. Change the title to something new:

```mdx index.mdx {2}
---
title: "Welcome to our docs"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Test locally

See your changes before publishing:

```bash
mint dev
```

Open `localhost:3000` to preview your site.

## Custom domain

Ready to use your own domain instead of the Mintlify subdomain?

Head to [Domain Setup](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/custom-domain) in your dashboard.

Enter your domain (like `docs.yourcompany.com`) and configure these DNS settings with your domain provider:

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or your subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes typically take 15-30 minutes but can take up to 48 hours in some cases.
