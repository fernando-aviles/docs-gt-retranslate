# Clear browser cache

## When to clear your browser cache

Browser cache stores temporary files, images, and data from websites to make them load faster on subsequent visits. However, cached content can sometimes cause issues with documentation sites, including:

- **Outdated content**: You may see old versions of pages even after they've been updated
- **Broken functionality**: Cached JavaScript or CSS files may conflict with new site features
- **Authentication issues**: Cached authentication tokens may prevent proper login
- **Missing updates**: New features or content may not appear due to cached resources
- **Display problems**: Styling issues or layout problems from cached CSS files

You should clear your browser cache when:
- Documentation appears outdated despite recent updates
- You're experiencing login or authentication problems
- Pages are not displaying correctly or missing new features
- You're troubleshooting any website functionality issues
- You've been instructed to do so by support
