## Overview

The Docs to PDF export feature allows you to generate a comprehensive PDF version of your entire documentation. This can be useful for:

- Providing offline access to your documentation
- Creating shareable versions for stakeholders
- Archiving specific versions of your documentation
- Meeting compliance or internal requirements

## How to Export Your Docs

To export your documentation to PDF:

1. Navigate to the **Dashboard**
2. Go to **Settings**
3. Select the **General** tab
4. Find the **Export Content** section
5. Click on **Export all content to PDF**

<Warning>
  Currently, you can only export your entire documentation. Exporting individual pages is not supported yet.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  The PDF cannot be modified within Mintlify after generation. Custom styling options will be added in future updates.

## Upcoming Improvements

We're actively working on enhancing the PDF export functionality based on user feedback. Some features we're considering include:

- Selective page exports
- Custom PDF templates
- Cover page customization
- Table of contents configuration
- Header and footer customization
