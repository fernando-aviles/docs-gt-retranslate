To add the [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) cookie consent manager, add the following to your `mint.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
"integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
}
```

```json Example
"integrations": {
    "osano": "https://cmp.osano.com/2sUB2dqwqdkks/8dqwd-dwd86Â£-4a9b/osano.js"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `SOURCE` with your Osano script URL (found as the `src` value in your Osano-generated code snippet, starting with `https://cmp.osano.com/`).
