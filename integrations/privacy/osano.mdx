To add the [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) cookie consent manager, include the following in your `mint.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
"integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `SOURCE` with your Osano script URL from your Osano dashboard. The URL looks like `https://cmp.osano.com/YOUR_UNIQUE_ID/osano.js`.
