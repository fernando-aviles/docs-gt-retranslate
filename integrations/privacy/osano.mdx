To add the [Osano](https://www.osano.com/) cookie consent manager, add the following to your `mint.json` file:

<CodeGroup>

```json Integration options in mint.json
"integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
}
```

```json Example
"integrations": {
    "osano": "https://cmp.osano.com/2sUB2dqwqdkks/8dqwd-dwd86Â£-4a9b/osano.js"
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Replace `SOURCE` with your Osano script URL. You can find this URL in your Osano dashboard - it will start with `https://cmp.osano.com/`.
