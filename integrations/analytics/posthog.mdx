Configure PostHog analytics by adding the following to your `mint.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json mint.json
"analytics": {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "required",
        "apiHost": "optional" // Only needed for self-hosted PostHog
    }
}
```

```json Example
"analytics": {
    "posthog": {
        "apiKey": "phc_TXdpocbYTeZVm5VJmMzHTMrCofBQu3e0kN7HGMNGTVW"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>
