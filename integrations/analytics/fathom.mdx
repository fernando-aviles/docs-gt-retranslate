To enable Fathom analytics, add this configuration to your `mint.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json Analytics options in mint.json
"analytics": {
    "fathom": {
        "siteId": "required"
    }
}
```

```json Example
"analytics": {
    "fathom": {
        "siteId": "YSVMSDAY"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Your `siteId` can be found in your Fathom script settings.
