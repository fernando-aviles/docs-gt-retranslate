To track user analytics with Amplitude:

1. Add your Amplitude API key to `mint.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json Analytics options in mint.json
"analytics": {
    "amplitude": {
        "apiKey": "required"
    }
}
```

```json Example with API key
"analytics": {
    "amplitude": {
        "apiKey": "76bb138bf3fbf58186XXX00000"
    }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

That's it! Your docs will now send page views to Amplitude.
