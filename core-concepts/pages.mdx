description: "Pages are the building blocks of your documentation"
icon: 'letter-text'

<Note>
  Every page in your documentation is an MDX file. MDX lets you use React components alongside Markdown, giving you the best of both worlds!
</Note>

## Page Metadata

Every page starts with metadata between `---` markers. This tells Mintlify how to display your page.

<CodeGroup>
  ```mdx Basic Example
  ---
  title: "Getting Started"
  description: "Learn how to use our platform in 5 minutes"
  ---
  ```

  ```mdx With Icon
  ---
  title: "API Reference"
  description: "Detailed API documentation"
  icon: "code"
  ---
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Essential Metadata Fields

<ResponseField name="title" type="string" required>
  The main title of your page - appears at the top and in navigation
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string">
  A brief summary that appears under the title and helps with SEO
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="icon" type="string">
  Add a visual element from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) or [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons)
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  Use `sidebarTitle` to show a shorter title in the navigation while keeping your full title on the page.
</Tip>

```

### Search Optimization

Help users find your content by adding keywords:

```mdx

```

### Social Sharing

Customize how your page appears when shared on social media:

```mdx
