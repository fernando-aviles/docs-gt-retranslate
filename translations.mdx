  Automated translations are available as a paid add-on to Growth, Pro, and Enterprise plans. Please{" "}

## Overview

You can automatically translate your documentation into multiple languages while maintaining structure, formatting, and links with AI. Translations integrate with the [languages](/navigation#languages) feature, allowing readers to switch between available languages in your documentation.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a Growth, Pro, or Enterprise plan and translation add-ons for your target languages.
- You must use GitHub as your repository provider for your documentation content.
- Your documentation must use English as a base language.
- You must have a valid `docs.json` file in your repository.
- All content to be translated must use valid `MDX` formatting. Any invalid `MDX` will cause the translation to fail.

## Getting Started

Start with a complete translation of your documentation into each of your preferred languages. This approach ensures complete coverage in each language and automatically updates your `docs.json` file.

You can initiate a complete translation from the translations page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/translations).

1. Select **Start translation**.
2. Select the first language that you want to translate your content to and then select **Start translation**.
3. The translation process will create a new branch and pull request in your Mintlify project repository with the translated content. Larger documentation sets may take longer to process.
4. Review the pull request and merge it.
5. Repeat the process for each language that you want to translate to.

<Info>
  By default, automated translations are stored under a directory named after the [language code](/navigation#languages) that you have selected. However, you can now configure custom directory names for your translations if needed.
</Info>

## Custom Directory Names

You can configure custom directory names for your translations by modifying your `docs.json` file. While the default behavior uses language codes (e.g., `es` for Spanish, `fr` for French), you can specify custom paths for each language.

To configure custom directory names, update your `docs.json` file with custom paths in the languages configuration:

```json
{
  "languages": [
    {
      "name": "English",
      "code": "en"
    },
    {
      "name": "Español",
      "code": "es",
      "path": "spanish"
    },
    {
      "name": "Français", 
      "code": "fr",
      "path": "french"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
- Spanish translations will be stored in a `spanish/` directory instead of `es/`
- French translations will be stored in a `french/` directory instead of `fr/`
- English (the base language) doesn't require a custom path

You can use any valid directory name for your custom paths, such as:
- Full language names: `spanish`, `french`, `german`
- Regional variants: `spanish-mx`, `english-uk`
- Custom naming schemes: `docs-es`, `content-fr`

## Ongoing Translations

After adding a translation to your `docs.json` file, any future changes to your documentation are automatically translated as long as you maintain a subscription to the translation add-on for your configured languages.

The ongoing translation process follows this sequence:

1. A member of your organization makes changes to the documentation in your repository.
2. When the changes are pushed or merged into your main branch, the ongoing translation job is triggered.
3. The translation job updates, removes, or creates the required files in all subscribed languages based on your `docs.json` file configuration, using either the default language code directories or your custom directory names.
4. The translation job creates a separate branch and pull request containing the translated changes for your review.

<Info>
Mintlify will never automatically publish translations to production. You must review and merge each translation pull request before the changes are live.
</Info>

The automatic translation job doesn't handle manual changes to the localized files or the `docs.json` navigation trees well. Make all changes in your English content and let the translation service manage the localized versions.

We recommend promptly reviewing and merging translation pull requests so that your localizations are kept in sync.

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What content is translated?">
    The translation service translates all non-code, non-component content in your documentation. This includes:
    
    - Text
    - Links
    - Titles and descriptions in frontmatter
    - Component attributes
    - Navigation labels
    
    The service does not translate:
    
    - Code blocks
    - Images or other media
    - Metadata
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update my translations manually?">
    If you need to modify your translations, make any changes directly in the translation pull requests created by the translation service.
    
    Any manual changes may be overwritten the next time the English version of the page is updated and the translation job runs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my translation working?">
    Check these common issues:
    - Verify that your translation subscription is active for the language.
    - Confirm that your content uses valid `MDX` formatting.
    - Confirm that your `docs.json` file is properly configured.

    If you're still running into problems, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do translation PRs sometimes include unchanged sections?">
    The translation system operates at the page level, and will attempt to translate entire pages when any portion changes.

    This approach ensures that the translation is as accurate as possible and removes the need for manual updates to localized files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My desired language isn't available.">
    We offer translations for all languages supported by the [languages](/navigation#languages) feature.

    If the language you'd like to translate to is not listed, please [contact support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) and we'll be happy to assist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I define specific translations for words or prevent terms from being translated?">
    The translation service does not support custom translation rules for specific terms or phrases. We are developing this feature for a future release.
