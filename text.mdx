## Titles
Best used for section headers.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles
Best used for subsection headers.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>
Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and appears in the table of contents.

## Text Formatting
Common markdown formatting uses `**`, `_`, or `~` around text:

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

Combinations like `**_bold and italic_**` create **_bold and italic_** text.

For superscript and subscript, use HTML tags:

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages
Create links with `[]()`: `[link to google](https://google.com)` shows as [link to google](https://google.com).

For internal docs, use root-relative paths: `[link to text](/content/text)`. Avoid relative links like `[link to text](../text)`.

You can validate links using [our CLI](/development).

## Blockquotes
Add `>` for blockquotes:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

For multiline quotes, use multiple `>`:
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

## LaTeX
Use \$ for inline LaTeX: `$(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$` renders as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$.

Use \$\$ for equation blocks:
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$

## Line Breaks
Use double enter or `<br />` for line breaks:

```md
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```
