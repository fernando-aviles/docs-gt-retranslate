## Document Structure

### Page Titles and Headings

Headers help organize your content into a clear hierarchy. Use them to create logical sections that are easy to navigate.

#### Main Section Headers (H2)

Best used for major section headers. Create these with double hashtags:

```md
## Main Section
```

#### Subsection Headers (H3)

Best used for breaking down main sections into smaller topics. Create these with triple hashtags:

```md
### Subsection
```

<Tip>
Each heading automatically creates:
- An anchor link for direct navigation
- An entry in the table of contents
</Tip>

## Text Styling and Formatting

### Basic Text Formatting

Markdown provides several ways to format your text for emphasis. Here are the most common styles:

| Style         | Syntax            | Example Output   |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

### Combined Formatting

You can combine multiple styles together. For example:
- `**_bold and italic_**` renders as **_bold and italic_**

### Special Text Formatting

For technical and mathematical writing, you may need superscript and subscript text:

| Format     | HTML Syntax              | Result                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Superscript| `<sup>superscript</sup>`| <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript  | `<sub>subscript</sub>`  | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Hyperlinks and Navigation

### Internal Documentation Links

When linking to other pages in your documentation:

- Use root-relative paths starting with `/`
- Example: `[Text Guide](/content/text)`

<Note>
Avoid using relative paths like `../text` as they impact load performance.
</Note>

### External Links

For linking to external websites:

```md
[Link Text](https://example.com)
```

<Tip>
Use our CLI to validate all documentation links. Learn more in our [Development Guide](/development).
</Tip>

## Block Content

### Blockquotes

Blockquotes help emphasize quoted text or important notes. Create them by adding `>` before text.

#### Single-line Blockquotes

> This is a single-line blockquote example.

```md
> This is a single-line blockquote example.
```

#### Multi-line Blockquotes

> This is the first line of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second line, separated by a blank line with `>`.

```md
> This is the first line of a multi-line blockquote.
>
> This is the second line, separated by a blank line with `>`.
```

## Mathematical Notation

### Inline LaTeX

For mathematical expressions within text, use single dollar signs:
- Example: `$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$` renders as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$

### Block LaTeX

For standalone mathematical expressions, use double dollar signs:

$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$

```md
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$
```

## Text Layout

### Paragraph Spacing

Create clear separation between paragraphs using:
- Double line breaks in your markdown
- HTML `<br />` tags for explicit line breaks

Example:
```md
First paragraph

Second paragraph
```

Consistent spacing improves readability and makes your content more accessible to both humans and AI systems.
