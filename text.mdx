## Titles

Use these for main section headings.

```md
## Titles
```

### Subtitles

Use these for smaller section headings within main sections.

```md
### Subtitles
```

<Tip>

When you add a **title** or **subtitle**, it automatically creates a clickable link and appears in the table of contents on the right side.

## Text Formatting

You can format your text in different ways using markdown. Just put certain symbols around your text to change how it looks.

| Format        | What to Type      | How it Looks    |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can mix these together. For example, type `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

For small text above or below the line, use HTML tags. Add `<sup>` for above or `<sub>` for below.

| Type         | What to Type            | How it Looks           |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Above line   | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Below line   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Adding Links

To create a link, put the text in square brackets `[]` and the website address in regular brackets `()`. For example, type `[click here for Google](https://google.com)` to create [click here for Google](https://google.com).

When linking to other pages in your docs, start from the main folder. For example, use `[see our text guide](/content/text)` to link to the "Text" page.

Try not to use shortcuts like `[text guide](../text)` because they load more slowly.

You can check for broken links using [our CLI tool](/development).

## Blockquotes

### Single Line Quote

To make a quote, put a `>` symbol before your text.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiple Line Quote

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### Math Equations (LaTeX)

You can write math equations using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org). Put your equation between dollar signs ($). For example, `$(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$` shows up as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$.

For bigger equations on their own line, use two dollar signs ($$):

$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$

```md
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$
```

### Line Breaks

To start a new paragraph, press Enter twice when writing your text.

```html
<br />
```

```md
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```
