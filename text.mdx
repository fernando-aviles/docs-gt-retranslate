## Headers

Headers help organize your content into sections. Use `#` symbols - more `#` means a smaller header.

```md
## Large Header
### Medium Header
#### Small Header
```

<Tip>
Headers automatically create:
- Anchor links to jump to sections
- Table of contents entries on the right
</Tip>

## Basic Text Formatting

Here are the most common ways to format your text:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Write it like this
  **bold text**
  _italic text_
  ~strikethrough~
  ```

  ```md It shows up like this
  **bold text**
  _italic text_
  ~strikethrough~
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Combining Formats

You can mix and match formatting styles:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Example
  **_bold and italic_**
  ~**bold and strikethrough**~
  ```

  ```md Result
  **_bold and italic_**
  ~**bold and strikethrough**~
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Special Text Formats

### Superscript and Subscript

Use HTML tags for raised or lowered text:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Example
  Normal text with <sup>raised text</sup>
  Normal text with <sub>lowered text</sub>
  ```

  ```md Result
  Normal text with <sup>raised text</sup>
  Normal text with <sub>lowered text</sub>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Adding Links

Links are easy! Put the text in `[]` and the URL in `()`:

```md
[Click here](https://example.com)
```

### Internal Doc Links

When linking to other pages in your docs:
- ✅ Use root-relative paths: `/content/text`
- ❌ Avoid relative paths: `../text`

```md
[See our guide](/content/text)
```

## Blockquotes

Add quotes or callouts using `>`:

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Single Line Quote
  > This is a simple quote
  ```

  ```md Multi-line Quote
  > First line of the quote
  >
  > Second line of the quote
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Results in:
> First line of the quote
>
> Second line of the quote

## Mathematical Expressions (LaTeX)

### Inline Math
Use single `$` for math within text: `$E = mc^2$` becomes $E = mc^2$

### Display Math
Use double `$$` for standalone equations:

```md
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$
```

Becomes:
$$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$$

## Line Breaks

Create space between paragraphs by:
- Pressing Enter twice
- Using the `<br />` HTML tag

<CodeGroup>
  ```md Double Enter
  First paragraph

  Second paragraph
  ```

  ```md HTML Break
  First line<br />
  Second line
  ```
</CodeGroup>
