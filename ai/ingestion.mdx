## PDF Reference Documents

Upload PDF documents to enhance your AI Assistant's knowledge base with custom reference materials. This powerful feature allows your AI to provide more accurate and contextually relevant responses by referencing your specific documentation and procedures.

### How PDF References Enhance AI Responses

The AI Assistant can now access external information from PDFs uploaded via the Dashboard, significantly improving response accuracy even for information not included in your main documentation. When you ask questions, the AI can:

- **Reference specific sections** from your uploaded documents
- **Provide more accurate answers** by drawing from your custom knowledge base
- **Include contextual information** from internal procedures and guidelines
- **Maintain consistency** with your organization's standards and practices

This capability makes the AI Assistant much more valuable for teams with specialized knowledge, internal procedures, or domain-specific information that extends beyond standard documentation.

### Benefits of PDF References

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: AI responses become more precise with access to your specific documentation
- **Custom Knowledge**: Include internal procedures, style guides, and technical specifications
- **Contextual Responses**: AI can reference relevant sections from your uploaded documents
- **Improved Productivity**: Reduce time spent searching for information across multiple sources
- **Organizational Consistency**: Ensure responses align with your company's standards and procedures

### Supported Document Types

Upload various types of reference materials to improve AI Assistant performance:

- Internal documentation and procedures
