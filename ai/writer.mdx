</Info>

Writer is an AI-powered documentation assistant that helps you create and maintain technical documentation directly from Slack conversations and web content. It can read Slack thread links, fetch content from web pages, and perform web searches to generate comprehensive documentation.

## Key features

Writer provides several powerful capabilities for documentation creation:

**Slack thread integration**
- Reads and processes Slack thread links to extract relevant information
- Must be added to the channel you're linking from to access thread content
- Converts conversation context into structured documentation

**Web content fetching**
- Fetches content from any publicly accessible web page
- Processes HTML content and converts it to documentation format
- Useful for incorporating external resources and references

**Web search capabilities**
- Performs general web searches similar to AI assistant functionality
- Gathers up-to-date information for documentation accuracy
- Helps research topics and verify technical details

## Using Writer

To use Writer in your Slack workspace:

1. **Mention the bot**: Use `@MintlifyWriter` in channels where it has been added
2. **Provide context**: Share Slack thread links, web URLs, or describe what documentation you need
3. **Review output**: Writer will create or update documentation based on your request
4. **Provide feedback**: Report any issues or suggestions in the testing channel

## Current limitations

Writer is in active development with the following known limitations:

- Cannot re-edit previous pull requests when mentioned again
- Makes separate commits for each file update, which can be repetitive
- Requires manual review for technical accuracy
- Only works with publicly accessible web content for fetching

## Testing and feedback

Writer is available for testing with feedback encouraged. When testing:

- Try different types of content sources (Slack threads, web pages, search queries)
- Report any bugs or unexpected behavior
- Provide suggestions for feature improvements
- Test edge cases and complex documentation scenarios

The development team actively monitors for bugs and welcomes feedback to improve Writer's capabilities and reliability.
