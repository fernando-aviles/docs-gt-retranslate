Export your documentation in multiple formats for different use cases. Mintlify provides seamless export options for both individual pages and entire documentation sites.

## Markdown Export

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response accuracy, faster processing times, and lower token usage.

Mintlify automatically generates Markdown versions of pages that are optimized for AI tools and external integrations.

### .md URL extension

Add `.md` to any page's URL to view a Markdown version.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/ai/markdown-export.md">Open this page as Markdown</PreviewButton>

### Keyboard shortcut

Press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows) to copy a page as Markdown to your clipboard.

## PDF Export

Export your entire documentation site as a PDF for offline reading, sharing, and archival purposes. The PDF export feature converts your documentation into a professional, printable format while maintaining formatting and structure.

### Generate PDF documentation

1. Navigate to your documentation dashboard
2. Select "Export to PDF" from the export options
3. Choose which sections to include in the PDF
4. Download your complete documentation as a PDF file

### Use cases for PDF export

- **Offline documentation**: Access your docs without internet connection
- **Client deliverables**: Share comprehensive documentation packages
- **Compliance and archival**: Maintain versioned documentation records
- **Print-friendly format**: Create physical copies of your documentation
