# AI Assistant Credits

AI assistant credits are the billing units used to measure usage of Mintlify's AI-powered features. This page explains how credits work, where they're used, and how to track your usage.

## What is a Credit?

**1 credit = 1 AI message**

Credits are consumed each time the AI assistant generates a response to a user query. The billing is straightforward:

- Ask 1 question → Use 1 credit
- Ask 2 questions → Use 2 credits
- Ask 10 questions → Use 10 credits

Each interaction with the AI assistant, regardless of the complexity or length of the response, counts as one credit.

## Where Credits Are Used

AI assistant credits are consumed across three main areas of the Mintlify platform:

### Docs Side Panel
The most common usage of credits occurs through the AI assistant in your documentation's side panel. When users interact with the AI assistant while browsing your docs, each question they ask consumes one credit from your account.

### Slack Bot
If you've integrated Mintlify's AI assistant with your Slack workspace, each message sent to the bot will use one credit. This includes questions asked in direct messages or mentions in channels.

### Assistant API
When using Mintlify's Assistant API to integrate AI functionality into your own applications, each API call that generates an AI response will consume one credit.

## Tracking Credit Usage

You can monitor your credit consumption and remaining balance through your Mintlify dashboard. This helps you:

- Track usage patterns across different features
- Monitor credit consumption over time
- Plan for future billing cycles
- Identify which features are driving the most usage

## Credit Limits and Billing

Credit limits and billing details depend on your Mintlify plan. For specific information about:

- Monthly credit allowances

Credits are consumed in real-time as users interact with the AI assistant. Make sure to monitor your usage regularly to avoid unexpected overages.
