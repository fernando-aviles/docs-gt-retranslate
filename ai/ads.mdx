AI ads allow you to monetize your documentation by displaying contextually relevant advertisements powered by artificial intelligence. These ads are designed to be non-intrusive while providing value to your users through relevant product recommendations and services.

## How AI ads work

AI ads analyze your documentation content and user behavior to display targeted advertisements that align with your audience's interests. The system uses machine learning to optimize ad placement and relevance, ensuring a better user experience while maximizing revenue potential.

Key features:
- **Contextual targeting** - Ads match your content topics and user intent
- **Non-intrusive placement** - Ads integrate seamlessly with your documentation design
- **Performance optimization** - AI continuously improves ad relevance and click-through rates
- **Revenue tracking** - Detailed analytics on ad performance and earnings

## Enabling AI ads

To enable AI ads on your documentation site, add the `aiAds` configuration to your `docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "aiAds": {
    "enabled": true,
    "placement": ["sidebar", "content"],
    "targeting": {
      "categories": ["developer-tools", "api", "documentation"],
      "keywords": ["API", "integration", "development"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Ad placement best practices

### Sidebar placement
Sidebar ads work well for documentation sites with consistent navigation. They remain visible as users scroll through content without interrupting the reading experience.

```json
{
  "aiAds": {
    "enabled": true,
    "placement": ["sidebar"],
    "targeting": {
      "categories": ["developer-tools"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Content placement
In-content ads can be more effective but should be used sparingly to avoid disrupting the user experience. AI automatically selects optimal placement points within your content.

```json
{
  "aiAds": {
    "enabled": true,
    "placement": ["content"],
    "frequency": {
      "maxPerPage": 2,
      "minContentLength": 1000
    }
  }
}
```

## Revenue and analytics

AI ads provide detailed analytics to help you understand performance and optimize revenue:

- **Impressions** - Number of times ads are displayed
- **Click-through rate (CTR)** - Percentage of users who click on ads
- **Revenue per page** - Earnings breakdown by documentation page
- **Top-performing content** - Pages that generate the most ad revenue

Access your ad analytics through the Mintlify dashboard under the "Monetization" section.

## Privacy and compliance

AI ads are designed with privacy in mind:

- **GDPR compliant** - Respects user privacy preferences and consent
- **No personal data collection** - Targeting based on content, not user tracking
- **Transparent disclosure** - Ads are clearly labeled as sponsored content
- **User control** - Users can opt out of personalized ads

## Getting started

1. **Enable AI ads** in your `docs.json` configuration
2. **Set targeting preferences** based on your content and audience
3. **Choose ad placements** that work best for your documentation layout
4. **Monitor performance** through the analytics dashboard
5. **Optimize settings** based on user feedback and revenue data

AI ads typically take 24-48 hours to begin displaying after configuration. The AI system needs time to analyze your content and establish targeting parameters for optimal ad relevance.
