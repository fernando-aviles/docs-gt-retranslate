## Lists
### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

## Tables

Tables use pipes (`|`) to separate columns and hyphens (`-`) to create headers. For compatibility, add pipes on both ends of each row.
