## Lists
### Numbered Lists (Ordered Lists)

When you need to show items in a specific order, use numbers followed by a period. Here's an example:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

Here's how to write it:
```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Bullet Points (Unordered Lists)

When the order doesn't matter, you can use bullet points. You can create these using any of these symbols: dash (`-`), star (`*`), or plus (`+`). Here's how it looks:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

Here's how to write it:
```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Lists Within Lists (Nested Lists)

You can create sub-points by adding spaces before your bullet points:

- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-point 1
  - Sub-point 2
- Third item

Here's how to write it:
```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Sub-point 1
  - Sub-point 2
- Third item
```

## Tables

Tables help organize information in rows and columns. Here's an example:

| Property | What it means                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | How old the user is                   |
| Joined   | Shows if the user is a member or not  |


### How to Make a Table

<Tip>

Learn more about tables in the official [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

</Tip>

To create a table:
1. Use pipes (`|`) to separate your columns
2. Add three or more dashes (`---`) under each header
3. Put a pipe at the start and end of each row

Here's how to write the table above:
```md
| Property | What it means                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | How old the user is                   |
| Joined   | Shows if the user is a member or not  |
```
