Use banners to display important announcements, updates, or notifications across your entire documentation site. Banners appear at the top of every page and support Markdown formatting.

## Basic usage

Add a banner to your `docs.json` file:

```json
{
  "banner": {
    "content": "🚀 New feature released! Check out our latest updates."
  }
}
```

## Dismissible banners

Allow users to dismiss the banner by setting `dismissible` to `true`:

```json
{
  "banner": {
    "content": "📢 Maintenance scheduled for tonight at 11 PM EST.",
    "dismissible": true
  }
}
```

When `dismissible` is `true`, users can close the banner and it won't reappear for their session.

## Markdown support

Banner content supports Markdown formatting, including links:

```json
{
  "banner": {
    "content": "🎉 **Big announcement!** [Read our blog post](https://example.com/blog) for details.",
    "dismissible": true
  }
}
```

## Properties

<ResponseField name="content" type="string" required>
  The banner message. Supports plain text and Markdown formatting including links, bold text, and emojis.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="dismissible" type="boolean">
  Whether users can dismiss the banner. When `true`, users can close the banner and it won't reappear for their session. Defaults to `false`.
</ResponseField>

## Best practices

- Keep banner messages concise and actionable
- Use emojis sparingly to draw attention without overwhelming
- Include relevant links for users to learn more or take action
- Set `dismissible: true` for announcements that don't require persistent visibility
- Set `dismissible: false` for critical notices like maintenance windows
- Update or remove banners promptly when they're no longer relevant

<Note>
  Banners appear on all pages of your documentation site. Consider the user experience when deciding whether to make them dismissible.
