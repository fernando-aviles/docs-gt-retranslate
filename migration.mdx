## Quick Start

Install our migration tool:

```bash
npm install @mintlify/scraping
```

Then run one of these commands:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Multiple Pages
mintlify-scrape section [url]
```

```bash Single Page
mintlify-scrape page [url]
```
</CodeGroup>

The tool will automatically detect your documentation framework and handle the migration.
