    Mintlify is a modern documentation platform that helps teams create beautiful, interactive documentation websites.

You can write your content in Markdown files, configure your site with a simple JSON file, and deploy instantly to get a professional documentation site.

    3. **Add a mint.json file** to configure your documentation site
    4. **Create your first .mdx files** with your content
    5. **Deploy automatically** - your site will be live in minutes!
