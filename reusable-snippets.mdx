Reusable snippets help you maintain consistent content across your documentation by allowing you to create content once and reuse it in multiple places.

## Creating Snippets

All snippets must be created in the `snippets` directory. These files won't be rendered as standalone pages.

### Basic Snippet

Create a snippet with a default export:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. My keyword of the
day is {word}.
```

Use the snippet in your content:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
import MySnippet from '/snippets/my-snippet.mdx';

<MySnippet word="bananas" />
```

### Variables and Components

Export variables:
```typescript snippets/variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';
export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

Create reusable components:
```typescript snippets/component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Note>
  For client-side content, always check for `document` availability:
  `if (typeof document === "undefined") return null;`
