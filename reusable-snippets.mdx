When writing documentation, it's best not to repeat the same information in multiple places. Instead of copying and pasting the same content, you can create a "snippet" - a reusable piece of content that automatically stays the same everywhere you use it.

## Creating a Custom Snippet

**Important**: You must save your snippet file in the `snippets` directory for it to work properly.

Any file you put in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a reusable piece of content. These files won't show up as regular pages on your site. To use a snippet, you'll need to import it into another file where you want the content to appear.

### Basic Snippet Creation

1. First, create your snippet with the content you want to reuse:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. 
```

2. Then, add the snippet to any page where you want to use it:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet/>

```

### Adding Custom Variables to Snippets

1. You can make your snippets more flexible by adding variables. These are spots in your content that can change depending on how you use them:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```

2. When you use the snippet, you can fill in the variable with different content:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />

```

### Using Shared Variables

1. You can create variables that you want to use in multiple places:

```typescript snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Then use these variables wherever you need them:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### Creating Reusable Components

1. You can create more complex snippets (called components) that can handle different types of content:

```typescript snippets/custom-component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  When creating components this way, you'll need to use HTML-style tags instead of markdown. If you need to use markdown, create a basic snippet instead.
</Warning>

2. Use your component by importing it and providing the required information:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.mdx';

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />
```

### Content That Loads in the Browser

Most content on your site loads when the page is first built. But sometimes you need content that loads after someone visits your page. Here's how to create that:

```typescript snippets/client-component.mdx
{/* This code runs after the page loads in the browser */}
export const ClientComponent = () => {
  if (typeof document === "undefined") {
    return null;
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const clientComponent = document.getElementById("client-component");
      if (clientComponent) {
        clientComponent.innerHTML = "Hello, client-side component!";
      }
    }, 1);

    return <div id="client-component"></div>
  }
}
```
