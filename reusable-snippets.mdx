One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself), which applies to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should create a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a Custom Snippet

**Prerequisite**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory for the import to work.

Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
be rendered as a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and use it as a
component.

### Default Export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to reuse:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. 
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet/>

```

### Exporting with Variables

1. Add variables that can be filled in via props when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is `word`:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file with the variable. The property will be filled based on your specification:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />

```

### Reusable Variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```typescript snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```

### Reusable Components

1. Inside your snippet file, create a component that takes in props by exporting
   your component as an arrow function:

```typescript snippets/custom-component.mdx
export const MyComponent = ({ title }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <p>... snippet content ...</p>
  </div>
);
```

<Warning>
  MDX does not compile inside the body of an arrow function. Use HTML
  syntax when possible, or use a default export if you need to use MDX.
</Warning>

2. Import the snippet into your destination file and pass in the props:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { MyComponent } from '/snippets/custom-component.mdx';

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

<MyComponent title={'Custom title'} />
```

### Client-Side Content

By default, Mintlify uses server-side rendering, generating content
at build time. For client-side content loading, verify the
`document` object's availability before initiating the rendering process:

```typescript snippets/client-component.mdx
{/* `setTimeout` simulates a React.useEffect, which is called after the component is mounted. */}
export const ClientComponent = () => {
  if (typeof document === "undefined") {
    return null;
  } else {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const clientComponent = document.getElementById("client-component");
      if (clientComponent) {
        clientComponent.innerHTML = "Hello, client-side component!";
      }
    }, 1);

    return <div id="client-component"></div>
  }
}
```
