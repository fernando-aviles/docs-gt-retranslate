Reusable snippets help you maintain consistent content across your documentation by allowing you to write content once and use it in multiple places.

## Creating a Basic Snippet

1. Create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. 
```

2. Import and use the snippet in your document:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
import MySnippet from '/snippets/my-snippet.mdx';

<MySnippet/>
```

## Using Variables in Snippets

You can make your snippets dynamic by using variables:

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```

Use it in your document with a custom value:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
import MySnippet from '/snippets/my-snippet.mdx';

<MySnippet word="bananas" />
```

## Advanced Usage

For more complex use cases, you can also:
- Export reusable variables
- Create custom components
- Handle client-side content

<Note>
  Any file in the `snippets` directory will not be rendered as a standalone page.
