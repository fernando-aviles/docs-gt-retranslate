## Setup

Add `"versions": ["v2", "v1"]` to your `mint.json` file. The first version in the array serves as the default version. The versions dropdown will display versions in the order specified.

## Versioning Groups and Pages

Specify versions in two ways:
1. Add a version to a group in navigation (applies to all pages in that group)
2. Add a version to individual page metadata (takes precedence over group version)

<CodeGroup>
```json Groups (mint.json)
"navigation": [
  {
    "group": "Getting Started",
    "version": "v1",
    "pages": [...]
  }
],
```

```yaml Pages (quickstart.mdx)
---
title: 'Quickstart'
version: 'v2'
---
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Avoid nesting versioned groups within versioned groups. If nested, deeper versions take precedence.
</Warning>

### Versioning Tabs and Anchors

Add `version` to tabs or anchors in `mint.json` to show/hide based on versions. Unversioned items appear in all versions.

<CodeGroup>
```json Tabs
"tabs": [
  {
    "name": "API Reference V1",
    "url": "v1/api-reference",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  {
    "name": "API Reference V2",
    "url": "v2/api-reference",
    "version": "v2"
  }
],
```
</CodeGroup>

### Shared Content

Content without a specified version appears in all versions. When using localization with versioning, each version can have its own translations.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pages Show Up In Wrong Version" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Avoid nesting versions (e.g., group version "v1" with page version "v2"). This makes documentation harder to maintain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Pages" icon="circle-exclamation">
    Ensure version names in pages match exactly with versions in `mint.json`.
