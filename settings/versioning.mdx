Mintlify supports either versioning or localization. Note that you can use one or the other, but not both simultaneously.

These guides assume that your content for different versions is organized in folders named `v1`, `v2`, and so on. While this file structure isn't strictly necessary, it's recommended for keeping your content well-organized.

## Versioning

### Setup

Add `"versions": ["v2", "v1"]` to your `mint.json` file, where `v1` and `v2` are your version names. You can include any number of versions in this array. The first version listed will serve as the default version.

To explicitly specify a default version, use this format:

```json
"versions": [
  {
    "name": "version-name",
    "default": true
  }
]
```

<Tip>
  The versions dropdown menu will display your versions in the same order as they appear in `mint.json`.
</Tip>

### Versioning Groups and Pages

The recommended way to specify page versions is by adding a version value to a group in the navigation. When you specify a version for a group, that version applies to all pages within that group.

You can also specify the version of individual pages in their page metadata. Individual page versions always take precedence over group versions.

<CodeGroup>
```json Groups (mint.json)
"navigation": [
  {
    "group": "Getting Started",
    "version": "v1",
    "pages": [...]
  }
],
```

```yaml Pages (quickstart.mdx)
---
title: "Quickstart"
version: "v2"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  While it's technically possible to nest versioned groups within other versioned groups, we don't recommend this practice. If you do use nested versions, note that the more deeply-nested version takes precedence.
</Warning>

#### Versioning Tabs and Anchors

You can hide specific tabs or anchors based on version. This is useful when certain links are only relevant to a particular version. Important: this does **not** apply the version to the pages within that anchor.

In your `mint.json`, simply add a `version` property to your tab or anchor. Tabs and anchors without a specified version will be shown in all versions.

<CodeGroup>
```json Tabs
"tabs": [
  {
    "name": "API Reference V1",
    "url": "v1/api-reference",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  {
    "name": "API Reference V2",
    "url": "v2/api-reference",
    "version": "v2"
  },
  {
    "name": "Migrating from V1 to V2",
    "url": "https://mintlify.com/changelog/v2"
  },
],
```

```json Anchors
"anchors": [
  {
    "name": "API Reference V1",
    "url": "v1/api-reference",
    "version": "v1"
  },
  {
    "name": "API Reference V2",
    "url": "v2/api-reference",
    "version": "v2"
  },
  {
    "name": "Migrating from V1 to V2",
    "url": "https://mintlify.com/changelog/v2",
    "version": "v2"
  },
],
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Sharing Content Between Versions

Not all content needs to be version-specific. Any content without a specified version will appear in every version, eliminating the need for content duplication.

<Tip>
  When combining localization with versioning, each version can have its own set of translations. This allows you to maintain different language versions for different API versions, providing complete flexibility in managing both versioned and localized content.
</Tip>

### Troubleshooting

Here are solutions for common versioning issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pages Appear in Wrong Version" icon="circle-exclamation">
    This usually happens when you've nested versions incorrectly. For example, if your group has version "v1" but a page within it has version "v2".

    We recommend avoiding nested versions as they make documentation maintenance more difficult.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Pages" icon="circle-exclamation">
    If pages disappear from your navigation after adding versions, verify that the version names in your page or group metadata exactly match the version names in your `versions` array in `mint.json`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Localization

### Setup

You can use the `versions` field in your `mint.json` to create different language versions by adding a `locale` value to each version. The first localization in the array becomes the default localization.

Mintlify currently supports localization in:
- English (`en`)
- Chinese (`cn`)
- Spanish (`es`)
- French (`fr`)
- Japanese (`jp`)
- Portuguese (`pt`)
- German (`de`)

Here's an example configuration:

```json mint.json example
"versions": [
  {
    "name": "English",
    "locale": "en",
  },
  {
    "name": "French",
    "locale": "fr",
  },
  {
    "name": "Spanish",
    "locale": "es"
  }
]
```

<Tip>
  The versions dropdown menu will display your localizations in the order they appear in your `mint.json` file.
</Tip>

After completing the localization setup, you can manage your localized content using the same versioning mechanisms described above.
