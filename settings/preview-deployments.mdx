</Info>

Preview Deployments allow you to review changes to your documentation in a live environment without merging those changes to your production branch.

When you create a Pull Request or Merge Request in your Git repository, a preview URL will automatically be generated. The Mintlify bot will post this URL as a comment in your PR/MR. This preview URL will always display the latest deployment changes from your branch.

## Sharing Preview Deployments

Once a preview URL is generated, you can share that link with anyone to get their feedback on your changes.

### Authenticated Preview Deployments

To restrict access to your Preview Deployments, you can enable preview deployment authentication. With this authentication method enabled, only users who are authenticated with Mintlify will be able to access your Preview Deployments.

To enable preview deployment authentication, please [contact our sales team](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).
