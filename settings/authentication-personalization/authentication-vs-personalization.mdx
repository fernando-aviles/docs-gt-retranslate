Mintlify offers both Authentication and Personalization solutions. Authentication is essentially Personalization with added privacy features.

### Key Differences

**Security**
- Authentication provides complete privacy for all documentation content, images, search results, and AI chat features
- Personalization offers no security guarantees, with all content remaining publicly accessible

**Available Handshake Methods**
Both products support JWT and OAuth Handshakes, with additional options:

Authentication:
- Password Handshake (global password protection)
- Mintlify Dashboard Handshake (dashboard-based access control)

Personalization:
- Shared Session Handshake (simple endpoint setup for authenticated users)
