While Mintlify offers both Authentication and Personalization products, understanding their key differences will help you choose the right solution for your needs:

### Security Guarantees

Authentication provides complete privacy for your documentation:
- All page content and assets are inaccessible to unauthenticated users
- Search results and AI chat features require authentication
- Preview deployments can be restricted to authenticated users only

Personalization has no security restrictions:
- All content remains publicly accessible
- Hidden pages can still be accessed directly
- Best for customizing public documentation based on user attributes

### Available Handshake Methods

Both Authentication and Personalization support JWT and OAuth handshakes, with some method differences:

Authentication offers:
- Password Handshake: Protect docs with a configurable global password
- Mintlify Auth Handshake: Limit access to Mintlify dashboard users only

Personalization offers:
- Shared Session Handshake: Reuse your existing user sessions with a single endpoint
