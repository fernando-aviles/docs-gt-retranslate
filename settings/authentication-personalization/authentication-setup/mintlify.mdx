<Info>
  Mintlify Auth Handshake is for Authentication only, not Personalization.
</Info>

Mintlify handles authentication for your documentation. Users with dashboard access can automatically view your docs.

This method also secures preview deployments - only authenticated Mintlify users can access them.

<Note>
  Authentication requires approval. <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">Contact sales</a> for access.
</Note>

### Example

Let's say you want to restrict `docs.foo.com` to internal team members who also maintain the docs.

Just enable Authentication with Mintlify Auth Handshake in your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), 
then add your team members through the [organization settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/members).
