description: "Guarantee privacy of your docs by authenticating users"

Authentication offers full privacy for all of your documentation content by requiring users to authenticate before viewing any content, including:

- Documentation page content
- Images used in documentation pages 
- Search results
- AI chat interactions

You can authenticate users through the following handshake methods:

- [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
- [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt) 
- [OAuth 2.0](./authentication-setup/oauth)
- [Mintlify Dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Authentication is similar to our [Personalization](./personalization) offering but with guaranteed privacy. In addition to securing your documentation content, all features available via Personalization are also available via Authentication.

To learn more about choosing between Authentication and Personalization, read our guide on [Authentication vs. Personalization](./authentication-vs-personalization).
