description: "Guarantee privacy of your docs by authenticating users"

Authentication offers complete privacy for all your documentation content by requiring users to authenticate before viewing any content, including:

- Documentation page content
- Images used in documentation pages
- Search results
- AI chat interactions

You can authenticate users through several handshake methods:

- [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
- [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
- [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
- [Mintlify Dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Authentication is similar to our [Personalization](./personalization) offering but provides guaranteed privacy. In addition
to securing your documentation content, all features available through
Personalization are also accessible via Authentication.

For more information about choosing between these options, see our guide on [Authentication vs. Personalization](./authentication-vs-personalization).
