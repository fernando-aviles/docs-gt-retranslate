description: "Guarantee privacy of your docs by authenticating users"

Authentication offers full privacy for all of your documentation content by requiring users to authenticate before viewing any content, including:

- Documentation page content
- Images used in documentation pages
- Search results
- AI Chat interactions

You can authenticate users through the following Handshake methods:

- [Password](./authentication-setup/password)
- [JWT](./authentication-setup/jwt)
- [OAuth](./authentication-setup/oauth)
- [Mintlify Dashboard](./authentication-setup/mintlify)

Authentication is similar to our [Personalization](./personalization) offering but with guaranteed privacy. In addition to securing your documentation content, all features available via Personalization are also available via Authentication.

Check out our docs for more information on [choosing between Authentication and Personalization](./authentication-vs-personalization).
