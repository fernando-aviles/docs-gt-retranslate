Personalization refers to a suite of features that allow you to customize your
documentation experience based on information about the user. There are
three major features of Personalization:

- **Customize MDX Content** with user information such as name, plan, or title.

- **Prefill API Keys** in the API Playground for streamlined usage.

- **Selectively Show Pages** in the navigation based on user groups.

## How to Use

### Customizing MDX Content

When writing content, you can use the `user` variable to access any information you have sent to your docs. Here's a simple example:

Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!

```jsx
Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

This feature becomes even more powerful when paired with custom data about the user. Here's a real-world example that provides specific instructions about accessing the Personalization feature based on the customer's existing plan:

Personalization is an enterprise feature. {
user.org === undefined
? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
: user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
: <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}

```jsx
Personalization is an enterprise feature. {
  user.org === undefined
    ? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
    : user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
      ? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
      : <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}
```

<Note>
  The information in the `user` object is only available after a user has logged in. For
  logged-out users, the value of `user` will be `{}`. To prevent your page from
  crashing for logged-out users, always use optional chaining on your `user`
  fields (e.g., `{user.org?.plan}`).
</Note>

### Prefilling API Keys

When you return API Playground inputs in the user info, they will automatically be prefilled in the API Playground. Ensure that the field name in the user info exactly matches the name in the API Playground.

### Showing/Hiding Pages

By default, every page is visible to every user. To restrict which pages are visible to your users, add a `groups` field in your page metadata.
When determining which pages to show to the user, Mintlify checks which groups the user belongs to.
If the user is not in any of the groups listed in the page metadata, that page will not be shown.

```md
---
title: "Managing Your Users"
description: "Adding and removing users from your organization"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```

This table shows whether a page is visible based on different combinations of `groups` in User and page metadata:

|                                 | `groups` not in User | `groups: []` in User | `groups: ['admin']` in User |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------: | :------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| `groups` not in metadata        |          ✅          |          ✅          |             ✅              |
| `groups: []` in metadata        |          ❌          |          ❌          |             ❌              |
| `groups: ['admin']` in metadata |          ❌          |          ❌          |             ✅              |

<Note>
  An empty array in the page metadata is interpreted as "No groups should see this page."
