<Note>
  Personalization is an enterprise feature. To get access, [contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).
</Note>

Personalization lets you customize your documentation experience based on user information. Key features include:

- **Customize MDX content** with user information (name, plan, title)
- **Prefill API keys** in API Playground
- **Show/hide pages** based on user groups

## Usage Guide

### MDX Content Customization
Use the `userContext` variable to access user information:

```jsx
Hello, {userContext.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

<Note>
  Always use optional chaining (e.g., `userContext.org?.plan`) as `userContext` is `{}` for logged-out users.
</Note>

### API Key Prefilling
API Playground inputs are automatically prefilled when matching field names are returned in user info.

### Page Visibility Control
Control page visibility by adding `groups` in page metadata:

```md
---
title: 'Example Page'
groups: ['admin']
---
```

Visibility Rules:
- No `groups` in metadata: Visible to all
- Empty `groups` array: Hidden from all
- Specific groups: Only visible to users in those groups
