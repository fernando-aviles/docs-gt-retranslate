<Note>
  Personalization is an enterprise feature. To get access, [contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).
</Note>

Personalization lets you customize your documentation based on user information. Here are the three main features:

- **Custom Content**: Display personalized MDX content using user data (name, plan, etc.)
- **API Keys**: Auto-fill API Playground inputs
- **Page Access**: Control page visibility based on user groups

## Using Personalization

### Custom Content
Access user information with the `userContext` variable:

```jsx
Hello, {userContext.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

<Note>
  Always use optional chaining (e.g., `userContext.org?.plan`) as `userContext` will be empty (`{}`) for logged-out users.
</Note>

### API Keys
API Playground inputs are automatically prefilled when matching field names are provided in the user info.

### Page Visibility
Control page access by adding a `groups` field to your page metadata:

```md
---
title: 'Example Page'
groups: ['admin']
---
```

Only users belonging to the specified groups will see pages with group restrictions.
