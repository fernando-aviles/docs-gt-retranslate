<Info>
  This guide explains how to set up OAuth for **Personalization**. If you need to set up OAuth for **Authentication** instead, please check the [OAuth Authentication setup guide](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/oauth), as the steps are slightly different.
</Info>

If you already have an OAuth server that works with PKCE flow, you can connect it to Mintlify to create an easy login experience for your users.

## How to Set It Up

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    First, make an API endpoint that works with OAuth access tokens. This endpoint should send back user information in a JSON format that matches the [User](../sending-data) requirements. Make sure to note down what permissions (scopes) users need to access this endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Personalization Settings">
    Visit your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and follow these steps:
    1. Select the OAuth option
    2. Fill out these required fields:
    - **Authorization URL**: The main URL where users will start the authorization process
    - **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client's identification number
    - **Scopes**: The permissions you want to request from users
    - **Token URL**: The URL where access tokens are exchanged
    - **Info API URL**: The URL of your endpoint that provides user information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your OAuth Client">
    Find the Redirect URL in your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication). Copy this URL and add it to your OAuth server's list of allowed redirect URLs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

Here's a real-world example to help you understand the setup:

Let's say I have an OAuth server and want to set up authentication for my documentation site at `foo.com/docs`.

First, I create a user information endpoint at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`. This endpoint needs an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` permission to work, and it sends back user data in the format Mintlify expects.

Then, I go to the Mintlify dashboard's Personalization settings and enter these details:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

Lastly, I copy the Redirect URL shown in the dashboard and add it to my OAuth server's allowed redirect URLs list.
