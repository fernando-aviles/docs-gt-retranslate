title: 'OAuth 2.0 Handshake'
description: 'Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the PKCE flow'
---

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the OAuth **Personalization** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [OAuth **Authentication** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/oauth) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow, you can integrate it with Mintlify for a seamless login experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that can be accessed with an OAuth access token. This endpoint should respond with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format. Make sure to note the scope or scopes required to access this endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Navigate to your [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), select the OAuth option, and fill out the following required fields:

    - **Authorization URL**: The base URL for the authorization request. Mintlify will automatically append the appropriate query parameters.
    - **Client ID**: The identifier for the OAuth 2.0 client to be used.
    - **Scopes**: An array of scopes that will be requested during authentication.
    - **Token URL**: The base URL for the token exchange request.
    - **Info API URL**: The endpoint that will be called to retrieve user information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth client">
    Locate the Redirect URL listed in the [dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add it as an authorized redirect URL in your OAuth server configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

Let's say you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow, and you want to set up authentication for your documentation hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To implement this with Mintlify:

1. Create an endpoint at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info` that:
   - Requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope
   - Responds with the user's custom data according to Mintlify's specification

2. In the dashboard settings, navigate to the Personalization settings, select OAuth, and enter the following values:
   - **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
   - **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
   - **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
   - **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
   - **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

3. Finally, copy the Redirect URL from the dashboard settings and add it as an authorized redirect URL in your OAuth client configuration settings.
