title: 'OAuth 2.0 Handshake'
description: 'Integrate with your OAuth server to enable user login via the PKCE flow'

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the OAuth 2.0 **Personalization** Handshake. The steps for setting up the [OAuth 2.0 **Authentication** Handshake](/settings/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup/oauth) are slightly different.
</Info>

If you have an existing OAuth 2.0 server that supports the PKCE flow, you can integrate with Mintlify for a seamless login experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that can be accessed with an OAuth 2.0 access token, and create a response with a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format. Take note of the scope or scopes required to access this endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication), select the OAuth 2.0 option, and fill out the required fields:

    - **Authorization URL**: The base URL for the authorization request. We will add the appropriate query parameters to this URL.
    - **Client ID**: An ID for the OAuth 2.0 client to be used.
    - **Scopes**: An array of scopes that will be requested.
    - **Token URL**: The base URL for the token exchange request.
    - **Info API URL**: The endpoint that will be used to retrieve user info.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth 2.0 client">
    Copy the Redirect URL listed in the [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add it as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth 2.0 server.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example

I have an existing OAuth 2.0 server that supports the PKCE flow. I want to set up authentication for my docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

To set up authentication with Mintlify, I first create an endpoint at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`. This endpoint requires an OAuth 2.0 access token with the `docs-user-info` scope and responds with the user's custom data according to Mintlify's specification.

Next, I navigate to the Mintlify dashboard settings, go to the Personalization settings, select OAuth 2.0, and enter the relevant values for the OAuth 2.0 flow and Info API endpoint:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

Finally, I copy the Redirect URL displayed in the dashboard settings and add it as an authorized redirect URL in my OAuth 2.0 client configuration settings.
