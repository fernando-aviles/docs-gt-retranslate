<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Shared Session **Personalization** Handshake. The Shared Session Handshake is not available for Authentication.
</Info>

This method utilizes the session authentication info already stored in your user's browser to create a seamless documentation experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that uses session authentication to identify users, and responds with a JSON payload following the [UserInfo](../sending-data) format.

    For cross-domain setups, configure your API endpoint with:
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set to your docs domain (not `*`)
    - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header set to `true`
    
    <Warning>
      These CORS settings should only be enabled on the user info endpoint, not all dashboard routes.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add the API URL and your Login URL to your Personalization settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Setup

Here's a typical setup example:

- Dashboard location: `dash.foo.com` (with API at `dash.foo.com/api`)
- Docs location: `docs.foo.com`
- User info endpoint: `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`

In this case:
1. Create the user info endpoint that returns data according to Mintlify's specification
2. Configure CORS headers for `https://docs.foo.com` on this endpoint
3. Add `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` as your API URL in Mintlify dashboard settings
