title: 'Shared Session Handshake'
description: 'Seamlessly share user sessions between your dashboard and your docs'
---

<Info>
  This is the documentation for the Shared Session **Personalization** Handshake. The Shared Session Handshake is not available for Authentication.
</Info>

Use the session authentication info already stored in your user's browser to create a seamless documentation experience.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Info API">
    Create an API endpoint that uses session authentication to identify users and returns a JSON payload following the [User](../sending-data) format.

    If your API domain differs from your docs domain:
    - Add the docs domain to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
    - Set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true`
    
    <Warning>
      Only enable these CORS settings on the user info endpoint, not all dashboard endpoints.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your Personalization settings">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/products/authentication) and add your API URL and Login URL to the Personalization settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Setup

Let's say you have:
- Dashboard at `dash.foo.com` with API routes at `dash.foo.com/api`
- Docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`

1. Create an endpoint at `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`
2. Configure CORS for this endpoint:
   - Add `https://docs.foo.com` to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
   - Set `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to `true`
3. In Mintlify dashboard settings, set the API URL to `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`
