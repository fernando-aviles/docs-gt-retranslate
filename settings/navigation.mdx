  Quick Tip: Every page you add to your docs directory needs to be listed in your `mint.json` navigation to show up in the sidebar.

## Getting Started with Navigation

Mintlify offers three main ways to organize your documentation:

1. **Tabs** - For separating major sections (like "API" and "Guides")
2. **Anchors** - For highlighting important sections or external links
3. **Sidebar** - For organizing pages within each section

Let's look at how to set up each one.

## 1. Setting Up Tabs

Tabs appear at the top of your documentation and help separate major sections.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="/images/tabs-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="/images/tabs-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Add tabs to your `mint.json` like this:

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "API References",
        "url": "api-references"
    },
    {
        "name": "Guides",
        "url": "guides"
    }
]
```

<Tip>
  The `url` should match the folder name where your content lives. You can also link to external URLs.
</Tip>

### Customizing the Main Tab

Want to rename the default "Documentation" tab? Add this to your `mint.json`:

```json
"primaryTab": {
    "name": "Home"
}
```

## 2. Adding Anchors

Anchors highlight important sections in your docs or link to external resources.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="/images/anchor-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="/images/anchor-dark.png" />
</Frame>

Add anchors to your `mint.json` like this:

```json
"anchors": [
    {
        "name": "API Reference",
        "icon": "code",
        "url": "api-reference"
    },
    {
        "name": "Community",
        "icon": "comments",
        "url": "https://mintlify.com/community"
    }
]
```

Each anchor can have:
- A `name` (required)
- An `icon` ([Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icon name)
- A `url` (folder path or external link)

## 3. Organizing the Sidebar

The sidebar helps users navigate through your documentation pages.

### Basic Structure

Start with a simple group of pages:

```json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": ["quickstart", "installation"]
    }
]
```

### Creating Nested Groups

Need subgroups? You can nest them like this:

```json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": [
            "quickstart",
            {
                "group": "Advanced Setup",
                "pages": ["configuration", "customization"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Organizing with Folders

You can organize your files into folders for better structure. Here's how it works:

1. Create a folder (e.g., `guides`) in your docs directory
2. Add your MDX files inside that folder
3. Reference them in your navigation using the folder path

For example, if you have:
```
docs/
  └── guides/
      └── basic-setup.mdx
```

Your navigation would look like:
```json
"navigation": [
    {
        "group": "Guides",
        "pages": ["guides/basic-setup"]
    }
]
```

<Warning>
  Avoid using `api` as a top-level folder name - it's reserved by Next.js. Use `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>

## Customizing the Top Bar

### Adding Links

Add simple links to the top navigation:

```json
"topbarLinks": [
    {
        "name": "Blog",
        "url": "https://mintlify.com/blog"
    }
]
```

### Adding a Call-to-Action Button

Make important actions stand out with a CTA button:

<Frame>
  <img className="block rounded-md" src="/images/topbar-cta-get-started.png" />
</Frame>

```json
"topbarCtaButton": {
    "name": "Get Started",
    "url": "https://mintlify.com/get-started"
}
```

Want to showcase your GitHub repo? Use this instead:

```json
"topbarCtaButton": {
    "type": "github",
    "url": "https://github.com/mintlify/docs"
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Hidden Pages

Want pages accessible but not visible in the navigation?
1. Create your MDX file as normal
2. Don't include it in the `navigation` section of `mint.json`

These pages won't show in the sidebar but are still accessible via direct links.

<Note>
  Hidden pages aren't searchable by default. To make them searchable, add `"seo": { "indexHiddenPages": true }` to your `mint.json`.
