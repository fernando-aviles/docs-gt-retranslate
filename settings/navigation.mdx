## Navigation Basics

Your documentation's navigation structure is defined in the `mint.json` file. We'll walk through each element of navigation, from top to bottom:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Required Files">
    1. Make sure you have a `mint.json` file in your docs folder
    2. Prepare your content files (`.mdx` files) that you want to include in the navigation
    3. Think about how you want to organize your content into sections
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Pages to Navigation">
    To add pages to your navigation, update the `navigation` property in your `mint.json` file:

    ```json
    "navigation": [
        {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["quickstart", "development"]
        }
    ]
    ```

    <Note>
      You don't need to include the `.mdx` extension when listing pages.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Navigation Components

Your docs can use three main navigation components:

### 1. Tabs 

Tabs appear at the very top of your docs and help separate major sections.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="/images/tabs-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="/images/tabs-dark.png" />
</Frame>

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "name": "Guides",
        "url": "guides"
    },
    {
        "name": "API Reference",
        "url": "api"
    }
]
```

<Tip>
  Tabs work best for separating different types of content, like guides vs API reference.
</Tip>

### 2. Anchors

Anchors appear below tabs and can link to internal sections or external resources.

<Frame>
  <img className="block dark:hidden rounded-md" src="/images/anchor-light.png" />
  <img className="hidden dark:block rounded-md" src="/images/anchor-dark.png" />
</Frame>

```json
"anchors": [
    {
        "name": "API Reference",
        "icon": "code",
        "url": "api-reference"
    },
    {
        "name": "Community",
        "icon": "people-group",
        "url": "https://mintlify.com/community"
    }
]
```

### 3. Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar displays your main content structure. Here are different ways to organize it:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simple Groups">
    Basic grouping of pages under a section:

    ```json
    "navigation": [
        {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["quickstart", "installation"]
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Nested Groups">
    Groups within groups for more complex hierarchies:

    ```json
    "navigation": [
        {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": [
                "quickstart",
                {
                    "group": "Advanced Setup",
                    "pages": ["configuration", "customization"]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Pages in Folders">
    For organizing files in subdirectories:

    ```json
    "navigation": [
        {
            "group": "Guides",
            "pages": ["guides/getting-started", "guides/advanced"]
        }
    ]
    ```

    <Warning>
      The folder name `api` is reserved. Use `api-reference` instead for API documentation.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Top Navigation Bar

The top navigation bar can include links and a call-to-action button.

### Adding Links

Add links to the top bar using `topbarLinks`:

```json
"topbarLinks": [
    {
        "name": "Documentation",
        "url": "https://mintlify.com/docs"
    }
]
```

### Adding a CTA Button

Add a prominent button using `topbarCtaButton`:

```json
"topbarCtaButton": {
    "name": "Get Started",
    "url": "https://mintlify.com/start"
}
```

<Tip>
  You can also link to your GitHub repository by setting `"type": "github"`:

  ```json
  "topbarCtaButton": {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/mintlify/docs"
  }
  ```
</Tip>

## Hidden Pages

If you don't add a page to your navigation in `mint.json`, it becomes a hidden page. Hidden pages:

- Won't appear in the sidebar
- Are still accessible via direct links
- Aren't included in search results by default

To include hidden pages in search, add this to your `mint.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexHiddenPages": true
}
```
