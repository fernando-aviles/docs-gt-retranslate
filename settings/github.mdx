## Permissions

The GitHub App requires the following permissions:
- Read and write access to `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `pull requests`, and `workflows`

These permissions enable:
- Fetching and updating doc content
- Creating preview deployments for pull requests
- Managing branches and pull requests through the Mintlify web editor

<Info>
  The GitHub App only has access to repositories you explicitly grant it access to and follows your branch protection rules.
</Info>

You can modify repository access anytime in your [GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
