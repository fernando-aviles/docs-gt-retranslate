Mintlify integrates with the GitHub API, enabling synchronization between your
documentation and your GitHub repository. This integration is made possible through
the utilization of
[GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps).

## Installation

To begin, you need to install the Mintlify GitHub App into the GitHub account
where your documentation repository resides. Installing a GitHub App requires either
organization ownership or admin permissions in a repository. If you lack the
necessary permissions, the repository owner will need to approve the request.

You can access the installation page by logging into the
[Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to grant permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend this approach, as we only need access to the repository where
your documentation is hosted.

## Permissions

During the installation of our GitHub App, you will be prompted to grant the
following permissions:

- Read and write access to `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `pull requests`,
  and `workflows`

These permissions are leveraged to provide a seamless experience when managing
your documentation:

- When you make a commit to your configured documentation deployment branch,
  we fetch the contents of the changed files to update your documentation.
  This requires read access to your `contents`.

- When pull requests are created, we create a check and preview deployment,
  which requires write access to `checks` and `deployments`.

- Within the Mintlify web editor, Mintlify works on your behalf to create
  branches and pull requests, necessitating write access to `pull requests`
  and `workflows`.

<Info>
  If you are concerned about the write permissions, please note that the GitHub
  App will only have access to the repositories you explicitly grant it access to.
  Additionally, if you have branch protection rules in place, the App cannot
  push directly to your branchesâ€”it must abide by your branch protection rules.

## Repository Installations

When installing our GitHub App, you will be prompted to select either all repositories
or a specific subset. This selection can be modified at any time through the
[GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
