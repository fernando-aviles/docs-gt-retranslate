Mintlify integrates with the GitHub API, enabling synchronization between your
documentation and your GitHub repository. This integration is made possible through
[GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps).

## Installation

To begin, you need to install the Mintlify GitHub App in the GitHub account where
your documentation repository resides. Installing a GitHub App requires either
organization ownership or admin permissions for the repository. If you lack the
necessary permissions, the repository owner will need to approve the installation
request. You can access the installation page by logging into the
[Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

When installing a GitHub App, you can choose to grant permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend this approach since we only need access to the repository where
your documentation is hosted.

## Permissions

During the installation of our GitHub App, you will be prompted to grant these
specific permissions:

- Read and write access to `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `pull requests`,
  and `workflows`

These permissions enable a seamless experience when managing your documentation:

- When you make a commit to your configured documentation deployment branch, we fetch
  the contents of the changed files to update your docs. This requires read access
  to your repository's `contents`.

- When pull requests are created, we create a check and preview deployment. This
  requires write access to `checks` and `deployments`.

- Within the Mintlify web editor, we create branches and pull requests on your
  behalf. This requires write access to `pull requests` and `workflows`.

<Info>
  If you are concerned about the write permissions, note that the GitHub App will
  only have access to repositories you explicitly grant it access to. Additionally,
  if you have branch protection rules in place, the GitHub App cannot bypass them
  - it must follow your branch protection settings.

## Repository Access

When installing our GitHub App, you will be prompted to select either all repositories
or a specific subset. You can modify this selection at any time through the
[GitHub App settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
