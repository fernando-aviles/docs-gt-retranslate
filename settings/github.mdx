Mintlify integrates with GitHub through GitHub Apps to sync your documentation with your repository.

## Installation

Install the Mintlify GitHub App in your docs repository's GitHub account through the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). You'll need organization ownership or admin permissions. We recommend limiting access to only the repository containing your docs.

## Permissions

The GitHub App requires these permissions:
- Read and write access to `checks`, `contents`, `deployments`, `pull requests`, and `workflows`

These permissions enable:
- Fetching and updating doc content from your deployment branch
- Creating preview deployments for pull requests
- Managing branches and pull requests through the Mintlify web editor

<Info>
  The GitHub App only accesses authorized repositories and respects branch protection rules.

## Repository Access

You can modify repository access settings anytime through the [GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).
