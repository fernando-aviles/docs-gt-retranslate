Want to show your documentation on your own website address? You'll need to do two things: set up your desired web address in Mintlify's settings and update your DNS settings with your domain provider.

<Info>
  Want to create a subdirectory like mintlify.com/docs instead? You can find those
  instructions [here](/advanced/subpath/cloudflare).

## Dashboard Settings

1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Click on "Custom Domain"
4. Type in the web address you want to use. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Verification with Vercel

If you use Vercel to manage your domain, you'll need to add a verification `TXT` record. After you submit your custom domain, you'll see these details on your dashboard and receive them in an email.

## Setting Up Your DNS

1. Go to your domain provider's website and find your domain's DNS settings
2. Add a new DNS record with these exact values:

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

If you use Cloudflare to manage your DNS, make sure to turn on the "full strict" security option in the https settings.
