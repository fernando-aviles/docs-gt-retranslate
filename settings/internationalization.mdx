## Directory Configuration

### Custom Translation Directories

You can now customize the directory names for your translated content. This gives you more flexibility in organizing your multilingual documentation structure instead of being limited to default directory names.

To specify custom directory names for translations:

```yaml
i18n:
  directories:
    fr: "french-docs"
    es: "spanish-content"
    de: "german-documentation"
```

In this example:
- French translations will be stored in the `french-docs` directory
- Spanish translations will be stored in the `spanish-content` directory
- German translations will be stored in the `german-documentation` directory

If no custom directory names are specified, the system will use the default behavior of using language codes as directory names (e.g., `fr`, `es`, `de`).

### Benefits of Custom Directory Names

- **Better Organization**: Create a directory structure that matches your project's naming conventions
- **Improved Clarity**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content of each translation directory
- **Flexibility**: Adapt the directory structure to your team's specific needs and workflows

### Important Notes

- Directory names must be unique across all languages
- Names should only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
- The specified directories will be created automatically when translations are generated
- Changing directory names after content has been translated will require manually moving the files to maintain consistency
