When you change a file's path in your docs folder, the URL path to that page will also change. This commonly occurs when restructuring your docs or modifying sidebar titles.

## Broken Links

You can catch broken links using our CLI. Simply [install the CLI](/development) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

The CLI will identify any relative links in your docs that don't exist in your documentation.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field to your `mint.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This will permanently redirect `/source/path` to `/destination/path`, ensuring you don't lose any previous SEO value for the original page.

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` matches `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`:

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```
