Mintlify integrates with your source control provider to give you visibility into the status of your documentation deployments. This helps you verify that your changes have been successfully published.

## GitHub Checks

When you push changes to your repository, Mintlify automatically creates a check on your commit to indicate the deployment status.

### Successful Deployment

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img
    className="rounded-md"
    src="https://mintlify.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/mintlify/images/checks-passed.png"
  />
</Frame>

### Failed Deployment 

If there are any issues with the deployment, the check will fail and include details about what went wrong:

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-md" src="/images/editor-gate.png" />
</Frame>

## Preview Deployment Comments

When you create a pull request, Mintlify will automatically create a preview deployment and add a comment with the preview URL. This allows you to preview your changes before merging them into production.

<Info>
  Preview deployments are available on the Growth and Enterprise plans. Learn more about preview deployments in our [Preview Deployments guide](/settings/preview-deployments).
</Info>

The comment will include:
- A unique preview URL for your changes
- The deployment status
- Any error messages if the deployment failed

## Troubleshooting Failed Deployments

If your deployment fails, here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid Configuration" icon="gear">
    The most common cause of failed deployments is invalid configuration in your `mint.json` file. Verify that:
    - All required fields are present
    - The JSON is properly formatted
    - All file paths referenced exist
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Permissions" icon="lock">
    Ensure that:
    - The Mintlify GitHub app is properly installed and has access to your repository
    - You have the necessary permissions to deploy to the repository
    - Your account has been properly authenticated with Mintlify
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Build Errors" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If your deployment fails during build:
    - Check for any MDX syntax errors in your content
    - Verify that all images and assets are properly referenced
    - Review the error messages in the GitHub check for specific details
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Manual Status Check

You can also manually check the status of your latest deployment through the Mintlify dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Dashboard">
    Go to your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Your Project">
    Choose the project you want to check
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Deployment Status">
    Under the "Deployments" section, you'll see:
    - Latest deployment status
    - Timestamp of last successful deployment
    - Any error messages from failed deployments
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you need to trigger a manual update, you can do so through the dashboard's "Manual Update" button.
</Info>

## GitLab Integration

For GitLab repositories, Mintlify provides similar deployment status indicators through:
- Pipeline status badges
- Merge request comments
- Deployment status in the GitLab UI

The deployment status workflow is similar to GitHub, but appears in GitLab-specific locations within the UI.
