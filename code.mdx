## Inline Code

To add inline code, wrap text in single backticks: `like this`

## Code Blocks

### Basic Code Block

Create a code block by wrapping your code in three backticks (```). Add a language name after the opening backticks for syntax highlighting.

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

```md
\```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
\```
```

### Named Code Blocks

You can add a name to your code block by adding text after the language:

```javascript hello.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```md
\```javascript hello.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
\```
```

<Note>
  We use [Prism](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages) for syntax highlighting. See their documentation for a full list of supported languages.
